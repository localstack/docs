  Running LocalStack inside Podman
---

## Introduction

By default, the LocalStack CLI starts the LocalStack runtime inside a Docker container.
Docker may not be available on your system, and a popular alternative is [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/) which you can use to run LocalStack.
Podman support is still experimental, and the following docs give you an overview of the current state.

From the Podman docs:

> Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.
> Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine.
> Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (`alias docker=podman`) without any problems.

## Options

To run `localstack`, simply aliasing `alias docker=podman` is not enough, for the following reasons:
- `localstack` is using [docker-py](https://pypi.org/project/docker/) which requires a connection to `/var/run/docker.sock`
- Lambda requires mounting the Docker socket `/var/run/docker.sock` into the container (see [Lambda providers]({{< ref "user-guide/aws/lambda" >}})).

Here are several options on running LocalStack using podman:

### podman-docker

The package `podman-docker` emulates the Docker CLI using podman.
It creates the following links:
- `/usr/bin/docker ->  /usr/bin/podman`
- `/var/run/docker.sock -> /run/podman/podman.sock`

This package is available for some distros:
- https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/podman-docker/
- https://packages.ubuntu.com/impish/podman-docker
- https://packages.debian.org/sid/podman-docker

### Rootfull Podman with podman-docker

The simplest option is to run `localstack` using `podman` by having `podman-docker` and running `localstack start` as root

```sh
# you have to start the podman socket first
sudo systemctl start podman

# then
sudo sh -c 'DEBUG=1 localstack start'
```

### Rootfull Podman without podman-docker

```sh
# you still have to start the podman socket first
sudo systemctl start podman

# you have to pass a bunch of env variables
sudo sh -c 'DEBUG=1 DOCKER_CMD=podman DOCKER_HOST=unix://run/podman/podman.sock DOCKER_SOCK=/run/podman/podman.sock localstack start'
```

### Rootless Podman

You have to prepare your environment first:
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Podman#Rootless_Podman
- https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md
- https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman

```sh
# again, you have to start the podman socket first
systemctl --user start podman.service

# and then localstack
DEBUG=1 DOCKER_CMD="podman" DOCKER_SOCK=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock DOCKER_HOST=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock localstack start
```

If you have problems with [subuid and subgid](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Podman#Set_subuid_and_subgid), you could try to use [overlay.ignore_chown_errors option](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/controlling-access-rootless-podman-users)

```sh
DEBUG=1 DOCKER_CMD="podman --storage-opt overlay.ignore_chown_errors=true" DOCKER_SOCK=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock DOCKER_HOST=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock localstack start
```

### Podman on Windows

You can run Podman on Windows using [WSLv2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about#what-is-wsl-2).
In the guide, we use a Docker Compose setup to run LocalStack.

Initialize and start Podman:

{{< command >}}
$ podman machine init
$ podman machine start
{{< / command >}}

At this stage, Podman operates in rootless mode, where exposing port 443 on Windows is not possible.
To enable this, switch Podman to rootful mode using the following command:

{{< command >}}
podman machine set --rootful
{{< / command >}}

For the Docker Compose setup, use the following configuration.
When running in rootless mode, ensure to comment out the HTTPS gateway port, as it is unable to bind to privileged ports below 1024.

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "${LOCALSTACK_DOCKER_NAME:-localstack-main}"
    image: localstack/localstack-pro
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"
      - "0.0.0.0:443:443"
    security_opt:
      - "label=disable"
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?}
      - DEBUG=${DEBUG:-0}
      - PERSISTENCE=${PERSISTENCE:-0}
    volumes:
      - "${LOCALSTACK_VOLUME_DIR:-./volume}:/var/lib/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
```

The docker socket `/var/run/docker.sock` is correctly linked by default in a Podman setup.

To start the services, use `docker compose up` or `podman compose up`, depending on the availability of docker-compose.
