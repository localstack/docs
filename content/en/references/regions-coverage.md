## Introduction

LocalStack ships with multi-region support, enabling users to emulate different AWS regions and namespace resources based on the region.
LocalStack supports a wide range of AWS regions, including commercial, government, and China regions, providing a realistic environment for development and testing across multiple regions on your local machine.
