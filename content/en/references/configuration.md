  Overview of configuration options in LocalStack
aliases:
  - /localstack/configuration/
---

LocalStack exposes various configuration options to control its behaviour.

These options can be passed to LocalStack as environment variables like so:

{{< command >}}
$ DEBUG=1 localstack start
{{< / command >}}

You can also use [Profiles](#profiles).

## Core

Options that affect the core LocalStack system.

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `DEBUG` | `0` (default) \|`1`| Flag to increase log level and print more verbose logs (useful for troubleshooting issues)|
| `IMAGE_NAME`| `localstack/localstack` (default), `localstack/localstack:0.11.0` | Specific name and tag of LocalStack Docker image to use.|
| `GATEWAY_LISTEN`| `127.0.0.1:4566` (default in host mode), `0.0.0.0:4566` (default in Docker mode) | Configures the bind addresses of LocalStack. It has the form `<ip address>:<port>(,<ip address>:<port>)*`. |
| `LOCALSTACK_HOST`| `localhost.localstack.cloud:4566` (default) | This is interpolated into URLs and addresses that are returned by LocalStack. It has the form `<hostname>:<port>`. |
| `LEGACY_DIRECTORIES` | `0` (default) | Use legacy method of managing internal filesystem layout. See [Filesystem Layout]({{< ref "filesystem" >}}). |
| `PERSISTENCE` | `0` (default) | Enable persistence. See [Persistence Mechanism]({{< ref "persistence-mechanism" >}}) and [Filesystem Layout]({{< ref "filesystem" >}}). |
| `MAIN_CONTAINER_NAME` | `localstack_main` (default) | Specify the main docker container name |
| `LS_LOG` | `trace`, `trace-internal`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `warning`| Specify the log level. Currently overrides the `DEBUG` configuration. `trace` for detailed request/response, `trace-internal` for internal calls, too. |
| `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_PORTS_START` | `4510` (default) | Start of the [External Service Port Range]({{< ref "external-ports" >}}) (inclusive). |
| `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_PORTS_END` | `4560` (default) | End of the [External Service Port Range]({{< ref "external-ports" >}}) (exclusive). |
| `EAGER_SERVICE_LOADING` | `0` (default) | Boolean that toggles lazy loading of services. If eager loading is enabled, services are started at LocalStack startup rather than their first use. Eager loading significantly increases LocalStack startup time. |
| `ALLOW_NONSTANDARD_REGIONS` | `0` (default) | Allows the use of non-standard AWS regions. By default, LocalStack only accepts [standard AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html). |
| `PARITY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `0` (default) | Enables the use production-like access key IDs. By default, LocalStack issues keys with `LSIA...` and `LKIA...` prefix, and will reject keys that start with `ASIA...` or `AKIA...`. |

| `DATA_DIR`| blank (disabled/default), `/tmp/localstack/data` | **Deprecated.** Local directory for saving persistent data. This option is deprecated since LocalStack v1 and will be ignored. Please use `PERSISTENCE`. Using this option will set `PERSISTENCE=1` as a deprecation path. The state will be stored in your LocalStack volume in the `state/` directory |
| `HOST_TMP_FOLDER` | `/some/path` | **Deprecated.** Temporary folder on the host that gets mounted as `$TMPDIR/localstack` into the LocalStack container. Required only for Lambda volume mounts when using `LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER=false.` |
| `TMPDIR`| `/tmp` (default)| **Deprecated.** Temporary folder on the host running the CLI and inside the LocalStack container .|
| `<SERVICE>_BACKEND` | | **Deprecated.** Custom endpoint URL to use for a specific service, where `<SERVICE>` is the uppercase service name.
| `<SERVICE>_PORT_EXTERNAL` | `4567` | **Deprecated.** Port number to expose a specific service externally . `SQS_PORT_EXTERNAL`, e.g. , is used when returning queue URLs from the SQS service to the client. |
| `LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME` | `http://${LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME}:4566` | **Deprecated.** Name of the host where LocalStack services are available. Use this hostname as endpoint in order to access the services from within your Lambda functions (e.g., to store an item to DynamoDB or S3 from a Lambda). This option is read-only. Use `LOCALSTACK_HOST` instead. |
| `HOSTNAME_EXTERNAL` | `localhost` (default) | **Deprecated.** Name of the host to expose the services externally. This host is used, e.g., when returning queue URLs from the SQS service to the client. Use `LOCALSTACK_HOST` instead. |
| `EDGE_BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` (default), `0.0.0.0` (docker)| **Deprecated.** Address the edge service binds to. Use `GATEWAY_LISTEN` instead. |

| `INIT_SCRIPTS_PATH` | `/some/path` | **Deprecated.** Before 1.0, this was used to configure the path to the initializing files with extensions `.sh` that were found in `/docker-entrypoint-initaws.d`. This has been replaced by the [init-hook system](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/init-hooks/). |
| `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` | `http://elasticsearch:9200` | **Deprecated.** Use [`OPENSEARCH_CUSTOM_BACKEND`](#opensearch) instead. URL to a custom elasticsearch backend cluster. If this is set to a valid URL, then localstack will not create elasticsearch cluster instances, but instead forward all domains to the given backend (see [Custom Elasticsearch Backends]({{< ref "elasticsearch#custom-elasticsearch-backends" >}})). |
| `ES_MULTI_CLUSTER` | `0`\|`1` | **Deprecated.** Use [`OPENSEARCH_MULTI_CLUSTER`](#opensearch) instead. When activated, LocalStack will spawn one Elasticsearch cluster per domain. Otherwise all domains will share a single cluster instance. This is ignored if `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` is set. |
| `ES_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY` | `path`\|`domain`\|`port` (formerly `off`) | **Deprecated.** Use [`OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY`](#opensearch) instead. Governs how domain endpoints are created to access a cluster (see [Elasticsearch Endpoints]({{< ref "elasticsearch#endpoints" >}})) |

## Profiles

LocalStack supports configuration profiles which are stored in the `~/.localstack` config directory.
A configuration profile is a set of environment variables stored in an `.env` file in the LocalStack config directory.

Here is an example of what configuration profiles might look like:

{{< command >}}
$ tree ~/.localstack
/home/username/.localstack
├── default.env
├── dev.env

Here is an example of what a specific environment profile looks like

{{< command >}}
$ cat ~/.localstack/pro-debug.env
LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=XXXXX
DEBUG=1
DEVELOP=1
{{< / command >}}

You can load a profile by either setting the `env` variable `CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile>` or the `--profile=<profile>` CLI flag when using the CLI.
Let's take an example to load the `dev.env` profile file if it exists:

{{< command >}}
$ python -m localstack.cli.main --profile=dev start
{{< / command >}}

If no profile is specified, the `default.env` profile will be loaded.
While explicitly specified, the environment variables will always overwrite the profile.

To display the config environment variables, you can use the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ python -m localstack.cli.main --profile=dev config show
{{< / command >}}

The `CONFIG_PROFILE` is a CLI feature and cannot be used with a Docker/Docker Compose setup.
You can look at [alternative means of setting environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/) for your Docker Compose setups.
For Docker setups, we recommend passing the environment variables directly to the `docker run` command.
