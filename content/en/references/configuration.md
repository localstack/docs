  Overview of configuration options in LocalStack
aliases:
  - /localstack/configuration/
---

LocalStack exposes various configuration options to control its behaviour.

These options can be passed to LocalStack as environment variables like so:

{{< command >}}
$ DEBUG=1 localstack start
{{< / command >}}

You can also use [Profiles](#profiles).

Configurations marked as **Deprecated** will be removed in the next major version. You can find previously removed configuration variables under [Legacy](#legacy).

## Core

Options that affect the core LocalStack system.

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `DEBUG` | `0` (default) \|`1`| Flag to increase log level and print more verbose logs (useful for troubleshooting issues)|
| `IMAGE_NAME`| `localstack/localstack` (default), `localstack/localstack:0.11.0` | Specific name and tag of LocalStack Docker image to use.|
| `GATEWAY_LISTEN`| `0.0.0.0:4566` (default in Docker mode) `127.0.0.1:4566` (default in host mode) | Configures the bind addresses of LocalStack. It has the form `<ip address>:<port>(,<ip address>:<port>)*`. LocalStack Pro adds port `443`. |
| `LOCALSTACK_HOST`| `localhost.localstack.cloud:4566` (default) | This is interpolated into URLs and addresses that are returned by LocalStack. It has the form `<hostname>:<port>`. |
| `USE_SSL` | `0` (default) | Whether to return URLs using HTTP (`0`) or HTTPS (`1`). Changed with 3.0.0. In earlier versions this was toggling SSL support on or off. |
| `PERSISTENCE` | `0` (default) | Enable persistence. See [Persistence Mechanism]({{< ref "persistence" >}}) and [Filesystem Layout]({{< ref "filesystem" >}}). |
| `MAIN_CONTAINER_NAME` | `localstack-main` (default) | Specify the main docker container name |
| `LS_LOG` | `trace`, `trace-internal`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `warning`| Specify the log level. Currently overrides the `DEBUG` configuration. `trace` for detailed request/response, `trace-internal` for internal calls, too. |
| `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_PORTS_START` | `4510` (default) | Start of the [External Service Port Range]({{< ref "external-ports" >}}) (inclusive). |
| `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_PORTS_END` | `4560` (default) | End of the [External Service Port Range]({{< ref "external-ports" >}}) (exclusive). |
| `EAGER_SERVICE_LOADING` | `0` (default) \|`1` | Boolean that toggles lazy loading of services. If eager loading is enabled, services are started at LocalStack startup rather than their first use. Be aware that eager loading increases the LocalStack startup time. |
| `SERVICES`| `s3,sqs` | A comma-delimited string of services. Check the [internal health endpoint]({{< ref "internal-endpoints/#localstack-endpoints" >}}) `/_localstack/health` for valid service names. If `SERVICES` is set LocalStack will only load the listed services. All other services will be disabled and cannot be used. |
| `ALLOW_NONSTANDARD_REGIONS` | `0` (default) | Allows the use of non-standard AWS regions. By default, LocalStack only accepts [standard AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html). |
| `PARITY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `0` (default) | Enables the use production-like access key IDs. By default, LocalStack issues keys with `LSIA...` and `LKIA...` prefix, and will reject keys that start with `ASIA...` or `AKIA...`. |

| `DISABLE_TRANSPARENT_ENDPOINT_INJECTION` | `0` (default in Pro) \| `1` | Whether to disable DNS resolution of AWS hostnames to the LocalStack container. Pro feature. (see [Transparent Endpoint Injection]({{< ref "user-guide/tools/transparent-endpoint-injection" >}}))

## LocalStack Pro

| Variable             | Example Values | Description |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `ACTIVATE_PRO`       | `0` \| `1`&nbsp;(default)    | Whether Pro should be activated or not. This is set to true by default if using the `localstack/localstack-pro` container image. If set to `1`, LocalStack will fail to start if the license key activation did not work. If set to `0`, an attempt is made to start LocalStack without Pro features. |

## Legacy

These configurations have already been removed and **won't have any effect** on newer versions of LocalStack.
**Please remove them from your configuration.**

<!-- Note on ordering: The list is ordered first by version (descending) and then by Variable name (ascending). -->

| Variable | Removed in | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `<SERVICE>_BACKEND` | 3.0.0 | `http://localhost:7577` |  Custom endpoint URL to use for a specific service, where `<SERVICE>` is the uppercase service name. |
| `<SERVICE>_PORT_EXTERNAL` | 3.0.0 | `4567` | Port number to expose a specific service externally . `SQS_PORT_EXTERNAL`, e.g. , is used when returning queue URLs from the SQS service to the client. |
| `ACTIVATE_NEW_POD_CLIENT` | 3.0.0 | `0`\|`1` (default) |  Whether to use the new Cloud Pods client leveraging LocalStack container's APIs. |
| `BIGDATA_MONO_CONTAINER` | 3.0.0 |`0`\|`1` (default) | Whether to spin Big Data services inside the LocalStack main container. Glue jobs breaks when using `BIGDATA_MONO_CONTAINER=0`. | 
| `DEFAULT_REGION` | 3.0.0 | `us-east-1` (default) | AWS region to use when talking to the API (needs to be activated via `USE_SINGLE_REGION=1`). LocalStack now has full multi-region support. |
| `EDGE_BIND_HOST` | 3.0.0 | `127.0.0.1` (default), `0.0.0.0` (docker)| Address the edge service binds to. Use `GATEWAY_LISTEN` instead. |
| `EDGE_FORWARD_URL` | 3.0.0 | `http://10.0.10.5678` | Optional target URL to forward all edge requests to (e.g., for distributed deployments) |
| `EDGE_PORT` | 3.0.0 | `4566` (default)| Port number for the edge service, the main entry point for all API invocations. |
| `EDGE_PORT_HTTP` | 3.0.0 | `4566` (default)| Port number for the edge service, the main entry point for all API invocations. |
| `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` | 3.0.0 | `http://elasticsearch:9200` |  Use [`OPENSEARCH_CUSTOM_BACKEND`](#opensearch) instead. URL to a custom elasticsearch backend cluster. If this is set to a valid URL, then localstack will not create elasticsearch cluster instances, but instead forward all domains to the given backend (see [Custom Elasticsearch Backends]({{< ref "es#custom-elasticsearch-backends" >}})). |
| `ES_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY` | 3.0.0 | `path`\|`domain`\|`port` (formerly `off`) |  Use [`OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY`](#opensearch) instead. Governs how domain endpoints are created to access a cluster (see [Elasticsearch Endpoints]({{< ref "es#endpoints" >}})) |
| `ES_MULTI_CLUSTER` | 3.0.0 | `0`\|`1` |  Use [`OPENSEARCH_MULTI_CLUSTER`](#opensearch) instead. When activated, LocalStack will spawn one Elasticsearch cluster per domain. Otherwise all domains will share a single cluster instance. This is ignored if `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` is set. |
| `HOSTNAME_EXTERNAL` | 3.0.0 | `localhost` (default) |  Name of the host to expose the services externally. This host is used, e.g., when returning queue URLs from the SQS service to the client. Use `LOCALSTACK_HOST` instead.  |
| `KINESIS_INITIALIZE_STREAMS` | 3.0.0 | `"my-first-stream:1,my-other-stream:2:us-west-2,my-last-stream:1"` | A comma-delimited string of stream names, its corresponding shard count and an optional region to initialize during startup. If the region is not provided, the default region is used. Only works with the `kinesis-mock` `KINESIS_PROVIDER`. |
| `KINESIS_PROVIDER` | 3.0.0 | `kinesis-mock` (default) and `kinesalite` | |
| `KMS_PROVIDER` | 3.0.0 | `moto` (default), `local-kms` | `local-kms` has been removed. |
| `LAMBDA_CODE_EXTRACT_TIME` | 3.0.0 | `25` (default) | Time in seconds to wait at max while extracting Lambda code. By default, it is 25 seconds for limiting the execution time to avoid client/network timeout issues. <br> **Removed in new provider because function creation happens asynchronously.**|
| `LAMBDA_CONTAINER_REGISTRY` | 3.0.0 | `lambci/lambda` (default) | An alternative docker registry from where to pull lambda execution containers.<br> **Replaced by `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_IMAGE_MAPPING` in new provider.** |
| `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR` | 3.0.0 |  | Method to use for executing Lambda functions. For `docker` and `docker-reuse`, if LocalStack itself is started inside Docker, then the `docker` command needs to be available inside the container (usually requires to run the container in privileged mode). More information in Lambda Executor Modes.<br> **Removed in new provider. Mount the Docker socket or see [migration guide]({{< ref "user-guide/aws/lambda" >}}).** |
| | | `docker` (default) | Run each function invocation in a separate Docker container. |
| | | `local` (fallback) | Run Lambda functions in a temporary directory on the local machine. |
| | | `docker-reuse` | Create one Docker container per function and reuse it across invocations. |
| `LAMBDA_FALLBACK_URL` | 3.0.0 | | Fallback URL to use when a non-existing Lambda is invoked. Either records invocations in DynamoDB (value `dynamodb://<table_name>`) or forwards invocations as a POST request (value `http(s)://...`).<br> **Removed in new provider.** |
| `LAMBDA_FORWARD_URL` | 3.0.0 | | URL used to forward all Lambda invocations (useful to run Lambdas via an external service). <br> **Removed in new provider.** |
| `LAMBDA_JAVA_OPTS` | 3.0.0 | `-Xmx512M` | Allow passing custom JVM options to Java Lambdas executed in Docker. Use `_debug_port_` placeholder to configure the debug port, e.g., `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=_debug_port_`.<br> **Currently not supported in new provider but possible via custom entrypoint.** |
| `LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER` | 3.0.0 | | determines whether Lambda code is copied or mounted into containers.<br> **Removed in new provider because zip file copying is used by default and hot reloading automatically configures mounting.** |
| | | `true` (default) | your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by copying the zip file (potentially slower). It allows for remote execution, where the host and the client are not on the same machine.|
| | | `false` | your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by mounting a volume (potentially faster). This requires to have the Docker client and the Docker host on the same machine. |
| `LAMBDA_STAY_OPEN_MODE` | 3.0.0 | `1` (default) | Usage of the stay-open mode of Lambda containers. Only applicable if `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker-reuse`. Set to `0` if you want to use [Hot Reloading]({{< ref "hot-reloading" >}}).<br> **Removed in new provider because stay-open mode is the default behavior. `LAMBDA_KEEPALIVE_MS` can be used to configure how long containers should be kept running in-between invocations.** |
| `LAMBDA_XRAY_INIT` | 3.0.0 | `1` \| `0` (default) | Whether to fully initialize XRay daemon for Lambda containers (may increase Lambda startup times).<br> **the X-Ray daemon is now always initialized.** |
| `LEGACY_EDGE_PROXY` | 3.0.0 | `1` \| `0` (default) | Whether to use the legacy edge proxy or the newer Gateway/HandlerChain framework.  |
| `LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME` | 3.0.0 | `http://${LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME}:4566` | Name of the host where LocalStack services are available. Use this hostname as endpoint in order to access the services from within your Lambda functions (e.g., to store an item to DynamoDB or S3 from a Lambda). This option is read-only. Use `LOCALSTACK_HOST` instead. |
| `MOCK_UNIMPLEMENTED` | 3.0.0 | `1` \| `0` (default)  |  Whether to return mocked success responses (instead of 501 errors) for currently unimplemented API methods |
| `PERSIST_ALL` | 3.0.0 | `true` (default) | Whether to persist all resources (including user code like Lambda functions), or only "light-weight" resources (e.g., SQS queues, or Cognito users). Can be set to `false` to reduce storage size of `DATA_DIR` folders or Cloud Pods. |
| `SYNCHRONOUS_KINESIS_EVENTS` | 3.0.0 | `1` (default) \| `0` | Whether or not to handle Kinesis Lambda event sources as synchronous invocations. |
| `USE_SINGLE_REGION` | 3.0.0 | `1` \| `0` (default) |  Whether to use the legacy single-region mode, defined via `DEFAULT_REGION`. |
| `DATA_DIR`| 2.0.0 | blank (disabled/default), `/tmp/localstack/data` |  Local directory for saving persistent data. Use `PERSISTENCE` instead. |
| `DISABLE_TERM_HANDLER` | 2.0.0 | `""` (default) \| `1` | Whether to disable signal passing to LocalStack when running in docker. Enabling this will prevent an orderly shutdown when running inside LS in docker. Setting this to anything else than an empty string will disable it.
| `HOST_TMP_FOLDER` | 2.0.0 | `/some/path` |  Temporary folder on the host that gets mounted as `$TMPDIR/localstack` into the LocalStack container. Required only for Lambda volume mounts when using `LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER=false.` |
| `INIT_SCRIPTS_PATH` | 2.0.0 | `/some/path` | Before 1.0, this was used to configure the path to the initializing files with extensions `.sh` that were found in `/docker-entrypoint-initaws.d`. This has been replaced by the [init-hook system](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/init-hooks/). |
| `LEGACY_DIRECTORIES` | 2.0.0 | `0` (default) | Use legacy method of managing internal filesystem layout. See [Filesystem Layout]({{< ref "filesystem" >}}). |
| `LEGACY_INIT_DIR` | 2.0.0 | `1` \| `0`(default) | Used with `INIT_SCRIPTS_PATH`. This has been replaced by the [init-hook system](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/init-hooks/). |
| `MULTI_ACCOUNTS` | 2.0.0 | `0` (default) | Enable multi-accounts (preview) |
| `SQS_PROVIDER` | 2.0.0 |  `moto` (default) and `elasticmq` | |

| `USE_LIGHT_IMAGE` | 2.0.0 | `1` (default) | Whether to use the light-weight Docker image. Overwritten by `IMAGE_NAME`.|
| `LEGACY_PERSISTENCE` | 1.0.0 | `true` (default) | Whether to enable legacy persistence mechanism based on API calls record & replay. Only relevant for Community image, not relevant for advanced persistence mechanism in Pro. |
| `PERSISTENCE_SINGLE_FILE` | 1.0.0 | `true` (default)| Specify if persistence files should be combined (only relevant for legacy persistence in Community image, not relevant for advanced persistence in Pro version). |
| `PORT_WEB_UI` | 0.12.8 | `8080` (default) | Port for the legacy Web UI. Replaced by our [Web Application](https://app.localstack.cloud) |

## Profiles

LocalStack supports configuration profiles which are stored in the `~/.localstack` config directory.
A configuration profile is a set of environment variables stored in an `.env` file in the LocalStack config directory.

Here is an example of what configuration profiles might look like:

{{< command >}}
$ tree ~/.localstack
/home/username/.localstack
├── default.env
├── dev.env
└── pro.env
{{< / command >}}

Here is an example of what a specific environment profile looks like

{{< command >}}
$ cat ~/.localstack/pro-debug.env
LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=XXXXX
DEBUG=1
DEVELOP=1
{{< / command >}}

You can load a profile by either setting the `env` variable `CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile>` or the `--profile=<profile>` CLI flag when using the CLI.
Let's take an example to load the `dev.env` profile file if it exists:

{{< command >}}
$ python -m localstack.cli.main --profile=dev start
{{< / command >}}

If no profile is specified, the `default.env` profile will be loaded.
While explicitly specified, the environment variables will always overwrite the profile.

To display the config environment variables, you can use the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ python -m localstack.cli.main --profile=dev config show
{{< / command >}}

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
The `CONFIG_PROFILE` is a CLI feature and cannot be used with a Docker/Docker Compose setup.
You can look at [alternative means of setting environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/) for your Docker Compose setups.
For Docker setups, we recommend passing the environment variables directly to the `docker run` command.
