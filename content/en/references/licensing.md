  Service availability and licensing details across LocalStack for AWS tiers.
---

This document outlines the features, emulated AWS services, and enhancements included in each LocalStack for AWS tier.
It also clarifies how licensing works across workspaces and users.

As of **May 8, 2025**, LocalStack for AWS is offered in four tiers:

- Free
- Base
- Ultimate
- Enterprise (custom offering available via Sales only)

If you purchased a LocalStack license **before May 8, 2025**, [click here to learn about your available features and legacy entitlements](#legacy-plans).

### Licensing & Access Rules

Each **workspace** can only be assigned a single pricing tier.
You cannot mix and match (e.g., Base and Ultimate) within the same workspace.

Licenses must be assigned to individual users.
This generates an authentication token that enables access to the emulator and any enhancements included in the tier.

Not sure which tier fits your use case?
Explore our [pricing page](https://www.localstack.cloud/pricing).

For unique licensing needs across teams or environments, please contact Sales.

### Usage Allocation Per Workspace

All paid tiers include a fixed allocation of:

- CI credits (monthly pool)
- Ephemeral Instance minutes (monthly pool)
- Cloud Pod storage (per contract, shared across all users)

We will soon support self-service purchasing of additional credits, minutes, and storage.
Until then, please reach out to Sales if you need to expand your usage.

### Service Coverage Clarification

The table below shows which AWS services are available in each pricing tier.
It does not indicate the level of API coverage or feature availability.

To learn more about how a service behaves in LocalStack, refer to that individual service page or contact Support.
