If you have created a resource using LocalStack, such as an OpenSearch cluster or RDS database, you may need to access it from your application.
Typically, these resources are accessible through a URL or a hostname provided by LocalStack.
By default, LocalStack returns the hostname `localhost.localstack.cloud`, which resolves to LocalStack using DNS.
For special environments (e.g., proxies), the [configuration]({{< ref "configuration" >}}) `LOCALSTACK_HOST` customizes the URLs returned by LocalStack.
This guide will explore different scenarios and provide detailed instructions on accessing resources created by LocalStack under different scenarios.

## From your host

For example, suppose you have created an OpenSearch cluster using LocalStack and want to access it from the same computer.
In such a case, you can set the `LOCALSTACK_HOST` environment variable to specify the desired hostname and port that will be returned.
Check out the [service-specific documentation]({{<ref "user-guide/aws/feature-coverage">}}) for more details.

## From a container LocalStack created

Check out our documentation while [using the endpoint URL]({{<ref "endpoint-url#from-a-container-localstack-created" >}}).

The Lambda service in LocalStack also supports the <code>HOSTNAME_FROM_LAMBDA</code> environment variable, which can be handy if LocalStack is reachable through a specific hostname.
Suppose you're running LocalStack in a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/">user-defined network</a> using Docker, where the LocalStack container can be accessed from other containers in the network using its service name.
In that case, you can set the <code>HOSTNAME_FROM_LAMBDA</code> environment variable to this value to help resolve any issues with lambda functions accessing resources created by LocalStack.

## From your container

Check out our documentation [on using the endpoint URL]({{<ref "endpoint-url#from-your-container" >}}).

## From a separate host

LocalStack must listen to the address of the host, or `0.0.0.0`.
