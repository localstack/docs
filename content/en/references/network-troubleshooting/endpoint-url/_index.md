This documentation provides step-by-step guidance on how to access LocalStack services via the endpoint URL and troubleshoot common issues.

## From the same computer

{{< figure src="../images/1.svg" width="400" >}}

Suppose you have LocalStack installed on your machine and want to access it using the AWS CLI. To connect, you must expose port 4566 from your LocalStack instance and connect to `localhost` or a domain name that points to `localhost`. While the LocalStack CLI does this automatically, when running the Docker container directly or with docker compose, you must configure it manually. Check out the [getting started documentation]({{< ref "getting-started/installation" >}}) for more information.

{{<alert title="Note">}}
Additionally, if you bind a domain name to `localhost`, ensure that you are not subject to [DNS rebind protection]({{< ref "user-guide/tools/transparent-endpoint-injection/dns-server#dns-rebind-protection" >}}).
{{</alert>}}

You can also use the `EDGE_PORT` [configuration variable]({{< ref "references/configuration" >}}) to change the exposed port if necessary.

## From a container LocalStack created

{{< figure src="../images/4.svg" width="400" >}}

Suppose your code is running inside an ECS container that LocalStack has created. To enable access to the LocalStack instance, it's advisable to start LocalStack in a [user-defined network](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/), and then set the `MAIN_DOCKER_NETWORK` environment variable to this network's name. This allows the code running inside the container to access the LocalStack instance using its hostname. For example:

{{<tabpane>}}
{{<tab header="CLI" lang="bash">}}
# create the network
docker network create my-network
# launch localstack
MAIN_DOCKER_NETWORK=my-network DOCKER_FLAGS="--network my-network" localstack start
# then your code can access localstack at its container name (by default: localstack_main)
aws --endpoint-url http://localstack_main:4566 s3api list-buckets
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab header="Docker" lang="bash">}}
# create the network
docker network create my-network
# launch localstack
docker run --rm -it --network my-network -e MAIN_DOCKER_NETWORK=my-network <other flags> localstack/localstack[-pro]
# then your code can access localstack at its container name (by default: localstack_main)
aws --endpoint-url http://localstack_main:4566 s3api list-buckets
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab header="docker-compose.yml" lang="yml">}}
services:
  localstack:
    # ... other configuration here
    environment:
      MAIN_DOCKER_NETWORK=ls
    networks:
    - ls
networks:
  ls:
    name: ls

# Your application code can then use
# http://localstack:4566 for the
# endpoint url
{{</tab>}}
{{</tabpane>}}

## From your container

{{< figure src="../images/7.svg" width="400" >}}

Suppose you're accessing AWS resources such as S3 in LocalStack by running your application code in a container. To facilitate access to LocalStack from within the container, it's recommended to start LocalStack in a [user-defined network](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/) and set the MAIN_DOCKER_NETWORK environment variable to the network's name. Doing so enables the containerized code to connect to the LocalStack instance using its hostname. For instance:

{{<tabpane>}}
{{<tab header="CLI" lang="bash">}}
# create the network
docker network create my-network
# launch localstack
DOCKER_FLAGS="--network my-network" localstack start
# launch your container
docker run --rm it --network my-network <image name>
# then your code can access localstack at its container name (by default: localstack_main)
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab header="Docker" lang="bash">}}
# create the network
docker network create my-network
# launch localstack
docker run --rm -it --network my-network <other flags> localstack/localstack[-pro]
# launch your container
docker run --rm it --network my-network <image name>
# then your code can access localstack at its container name (by default: localstack_main)
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab header="docker-compose.yml" lang="yml">}}
services:
  localstack:
    # ... other configuration here
    networks:
    - ls
  your_container:
    # ... other configuration here
    networks:
    - ls
networks:
  ls:
    name: ls

# Your application code can then use
# http://localstack:4566 for the
# endpoint url
{{</tab>}}
{{</tabpane>}}

### Wildcard DNS access

{{<alert title="Note">}}
The Wildcard DNS access feature is part of [LocalStack's Pro/Team offering](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) and requires an API key to be configured.
{{</alert>}}

Certain resources created by LocalStack can be accessed using virtual host addressing. For example, an S3 bucket can be accessed at the following address format: `<bucket>.s3.<region>.localhost.localstack.cloud`. 

By default, the LocalStack container cannot be reached from containers running in your Docker network at the above address. This is because any subdomains of `localhost.localstack.cloud` is resolved to `127.0.0.1` within the Docker network. 

If Docker supported wildcard DNS configuration with `--network-alias` (Docker CLI) or `aliases:` (`docker-compose`), this could be solved with Docker configuration alone.

To map more complex domain names to the LocalStack container within the Docker network, the LocalStack container can be utilized as a DNS server. However, this approach requires additional configuration steps. 

Specifically, the LocalStack container must have a static IP address within the network. To set up the LocalStack container as a DNS server, a static IP address must be assigned within the Docker network. 

Here is an example of how you can set it up:

{{<tabpane>}}
{{<tab header="Docker" lang="bash">}}
# Create the network
docker network create my-network --subnet <ip address range CIDR>

# Start LocalStack
docker run --rm -it \
    --network my-network \
    --ip 10.0.2.20 \
    -e DNS_RESOLVE_IP=10.0.2.20 \
    <other flags> \
    localstack/localstack-pro

# Start your application container
docker run --rm -it \
    --dns 10.0.2.20 \
    --network my-network \
    <args>
# Your code can now access LocalStack at <subdomain>.localhost.localstack.cloud
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab header="docker-compose.yml" lang="yaml">}}
services:
  localstack:
    # ... other configuration here
    environment:
      - DNS_RESOLVE_IP=10.0.2.20
    networks:
      ls:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.2.20

  application:
    # ... other configuration here
    dns:
      - 10.0.2.20
    networks:
      ls:

networks:
  ls:
    name: ls
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
{{</tab>}}
{{</tabpane>}}

To access LocalStack resources from the *application* container, you can make requests to the following address format: `<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/<key>`. This will ensure that the requests reach the LocalStack container.

{{<alert title="Note">}}
For optimal configuration, we recommend using a private IP address range, such as 10.0.0.0/8, for your containers. This helps avoid conflicts with IP addresses assigned by Docker.
Additionally, it's advisable to avoid using `X.X.X.1` as an IP address, as it is commonly reserved for the host within that subnet.
{{</alert>}}

## From a separate host

{{< figure src="../images/10.svg" width="400" >}}

LocalStack must listen to the address of the host, or `0.0.0.0`.

{{<tabpane>}}
{{<tab header="CLI" lang="bash">}}
EDGE_BIND_HOST="0.0.0.0" localstack start
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab header="Docker" lang="bash">}}
# this command exposes ports on all interfaces by default
docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 <additional arguments> localstack
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab header="docker-compose" lang="yaml">}}
services:
  localstack:
    # ... other configuration here
    ports:
      - "4566:4566"
      # ... other ports
{{</tab>}}
{{</tabpane>}}
