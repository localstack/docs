Suppose you're attempting to access LocalStack, but you're relying on transparent endpoint injection to redirect AWS (`*.amazonaws.com`) requests. In such cases, there are different approaches you can take depending on your setup.

## From your host

If you're using LocalStack with an [auth token]({{<ref "getting-started/auth-token">}}), then you can utilize the [DNS server]({{<ref "dns-server">}}) to perform requests to LocalStack as if it were AWS.
You need to make two changes:

* Publish port 53 from the LocalStack docker container to your host.
* Configure your host to use the LocalStack DNS server by default.

For more details, see your [DNS server documentation]({{<ref "dns-server">}}).

For the community image of LocalStack, you can employ your own DNS server to achieve a similar outcome, but it won't be managed by LocalStack.
Note that in both cases, SSL verification must be disabled.

## From a lambda function
