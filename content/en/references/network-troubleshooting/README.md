# README for the network troubleshooting section

Images for the Network Troubleshooting section come from the tool https://excalidraw.com, and are saved in `diagram.excalidraw`.

Images for the overview page (references/network-troubleshooting/_index.md) are taken from the "Overview images" section of the diagram, in the lower left. Other images are numbered and correspond to `<number>.png` in the documentation repository.

When updating the diagram, the individual images can be saved as PNG by

1. selecting on the group of elements you wish to save as an image;
2. going to the main menu and selecting "Export image" (or press `Ctrl+Shift+E`):
3. selecting 2x scale, with "Background" and "Only selected" selected; and
4. saving the image to disk.
