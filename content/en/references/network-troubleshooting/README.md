# README for the network troubleshooting section

Images for the Network Troubleshooting section come from the tool https://excalidraw.com, and are saved in `diagram.excalidraw`.

Images for the overview page (references/network-troubleshooting/_index.md) are taken from the "Overview images" section of the diagram, in the lower left. Other images are numbered and correspond to `<number>.svg` in the documentation repository.

When updating the diagram, the individual images can be saved as SVG by

1. right clicking on the group of elements you wish to save as an image,
2. selecting "Copy to clipboard as SVG"; and
3. pasting from your clipboard into the file.
