  Overview of LocalStack and AWS specific internal endpoints for local development and testing
---

LocalStack provides several internal endpoints for various local AWS services and LocalStack-specific features. These endpoints are not part of the official AWS API and are available in the `/_localstack` and `/_aws` paths. You can use [`cURL`](https://curl.se/) or your favourite HTTP REST client to access endpoints.

## LocalStack endpoints
