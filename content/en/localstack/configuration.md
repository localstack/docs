  Environment variables which affect LocalStack.
---

LocalStack allows for many different configuration options.
You can pass these via environment variables, e.g., like the following:

{{< command >}}
$ SERVICES=kinesis,lambda,sqs,dynamodb DEBUG=1 localstack start
{{< / command >}}

## Core

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |

### Elasticsearch

{{% alert title="Deprecated" color="warning" %}}
While the ElasticSearch API is actively maintained, the configuration variables for ElasticSearch have been deprecated. Please use the [OpenSearch configuration variables](#opensearch) instead. The OpenSearch configuration variables are used to manage both, OpenSearch and ElasticSearch clusters.
{{% /alert %}}

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` | `http://elasticsearch:9200` | *Deprecated*. Use [`OPENSEARCH_CUSTOM_BACKEND`](#opensearch) instead. URL to a custom elasticsearch backend cluster. If this is set to a valid URL, then localstack will not create elasticsearch cluster instances, but instead forward all domains to the given backend (see [Custom Elasticsearch Backends]({{< ref "elasticsearch#custom-elasticsearch-backends" >}})). |
| `ES_MULTI_CLUSTER` | `0`\|`1` | *Deprecated*. Use [`OPENSEARCH_MULTI_CLUSTER`](#opensearch) instead. When activated, LocalStack will spawn one Elasticsearch cluster per domain. Otherwise all domains will share a single cluster instance. This is ignored if `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` is set. |
| `ES_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY` | `path`\|`domain`\|`port` (formerly `off`) | *Deprecated*. Use [`OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY`](#opensearch) instead. Governs how domain endpoints are created to access a cluster (see [Elasticsearch Endpoints]({{< ref "elasticsearch#endpoints" >}})) |

| `KINESIS_INITIALIZE_STREAMS` | `"my-first-stream:1,my-other-stream:2:us-west-2,my-last-stream:1"` | A comma-delimited string of stream names, its corresponding shard count and an optional region to initialize during startup. If the region is not provided, the default region is used. Only works with the `kinesis-mock` `KINESIS_PROVIDER`. |

### Lambda

| Variable| Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR` |  | Method to use for executing Lambda functions. For `docker` and `docker-reuse`, if LocalStack itself is started inside Docker, then the `docker` command needs to be available inside the container (usually requires to run the container in privileged mode). More information in [Lambda Executor Modes]({{< ref "lambda-executors" >}}). |
| | `docker` (default) | Run each function invocation in a separate Docker container. |
| | `local` (fallback) | Run Lambda functions in a temporary directory on the local machine. |
| | `docker-reuse` | Create one Docker container per function and reuse it across invocations. |
| `LAMBDA_STAY_OPEN_MODE` | `1` (default) | Usage of the [stay-open mode]({{< ref "lambda-executors#stay-open-mode" >}}) of Lambda containers. Only applicable if `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker-reuse`. Set to `0` if you want to use [Hot Swapping]({{< ref "hot-swapping" >}}).|
| `LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER` | | determines whether Lambda code is copied or mounted into containers |
| | `true` (default) | your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by copying the zip file (potentially slower). It allows for remote execution, where the host and the client are not on the same machine.|
| | `false` | your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by mounting a volume (potentially faster). This requires to have the Docker client and the Docker host on the same machine. |
| `LAMBDA_TRUNCATE_STDOUT` | `2000` | Allows increasing the default char value for truncation of lambda logs.|
| `BUCKET_MARKER_LOCAL` | | Optional bucket name for running lambdas locally.|
| `LAMBDA_CODE_EXTRACT_TIME` | `25` | Time in seconds to wait at max while extracting Lambda code. By default it is 25 seconds for limiting the execution time to avoid client/network timeout issues.| 
| `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK` | | Optional Docker network for the container running your lambda function. This configuration value also applies to ECS containers. Needs to be set to the network the LocalStack container is connected to if not default bridge network. |
| `LAMBDA_DOCKER_DNS` | | Optional DNS server for the container running your lambda function. |
| `LAMBDA_DOCKER_FLAGS` | `-e KEY=VALUE`, `-v host:container`, `-p host:container`, `--add-host domain:ip` | Additional flags passed to Lambda Docker `run`\|`create` commands (e.g., useful for specifying custom volume mounts). Does only support environment, volume, port and add-host flags |
| `LAMBDA_CONTAINER_REGISTRY` | `lambci/lambda` (default) | An alternative docker registry from where to pull lambda execution containers.|
| `LAMBDA_REMOVE_CONTAINERS` | `1` (default) | Whether to remove containers after Lambdas being inactive for 10 minutes. Only applicable when using docker-reuse executor. |
| `LAMBDA_FALLBACK_URL` | | Fallback URL to use when a non-existing Lambda is invoked. Either records invocations in DynamoDB (value `dynamodb://<table_name>`) or forwards invocations as a POST request (value `http(s)://...`).|
| `LAMBDA_FORWARD_URL` | | URL used to forward all Lambda invocations (useful to run Lambdas via an external service).
| `LAMBDA_JAVA_OPTS` | `-Xmx512M` | Allow passing custom JVM options to Java Lambdas executed in Docker. Use `_debug_port_` placeholder to configure the debug port, e.g., `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=_debug_port_`. |
| `HOSTNAME_FROM_LAMBDA` | `localstack` | Endpoint host under which APIs are accessible from Lambda containers (optional). This can be useful in docker-compose stacks to use the local container hostname if neither IP address nor container name of the main container are available (e.g., in CI). Often used in combination with `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK`. |
| `LAMBDA_XRAY_INIT` | `1` / `0` (default) | Whether to fully initialize XRay daemon for Lambda containers (may increase Lambda startup times) |

### OpenSearch

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `OPENSEARCH_CUSTOM_BACKEND` | `http://opensearch:9200` | URL to a custom OpenSearch backend cluster. If this is set to a valid URL, then LocalStack will not create OpenSearch cluster instances, but instead forward all domains to the given backend (see [Custom Opensearch Backends]({{< ref "opensearch#custom-opensearch-backends" >}})). |
| `OPENSEARCH_MULTI_CLUSTER` | `0`\|`1` | When activated, LocalStack will spawn one OpenSearch cluster per domain. Otherwise all domains will share a single cluster instance. This is ignored if `OPENSEARCH_CUSTOM_BACKEND` is set. |
| `OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY` | `path`\|`domain`\|`port` | Governs how domain endpoints are created to access a cluster (see [Opensearch Endpoints]({{< ref "opensearch#endpoints" >}})). |

### StepFunctions

| `SQS_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY`| `domain`\|`path`\|`off` | Configures the format of Queue URLs (see [SQS Queue URLs]({{< ref "sqs#queue-urls" >}}))

## Security 

Please be aware that the following configurations may have severe security implications!

| Variable| Example Values | Description |

Please check with your SMTP email service provider for the following settings.

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `SMTP_HOST` | `localhost` | Hostname of the SMTP server. The port defaults to 25. |
| `SMTP_USER` |  | Login username for the SMTP server if required. |
| `SMTP_PASS` |  | Login password for the SMTP server if required. |
| `SMTP_EMAIL` | `sender@example.com` | Origin email address. Required for Cognito only. |


## Provider

Some of the services can be configured to switch to a particular provider:

| Variable| Valid options | 
| - | - | 
| `KINESIS_PROVIDER` |  `kinesis-mock` (default) and `kinesalite` |
| `KMS_PROVIDER` |  `moto` (default) and `local-kms` |
| `SQS_PROVIDER` |  `moto` (default) and `elasticmq` |

## Profiles

LocalStack supports configuration profiles which are stored in the `~/.localstack` config directory. A configuration profile is a set of environment variables stored in an `.env` file in the LocalStack config directory. Here is an example of what configuration profiles might look like:

```sh
% tree ~/.localstack 
/home/username/.localstack
├── default.env
├── dev.env
└── pro.env
```

Here is an example of what a specific environment profile looks like

```sh
% cat ~/.localstack/pro-debug.env
LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=XXXXX
DEBUG=1
DEVELOP=1
```

You can load a profile by either setting the `env` variable `CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile>` or the `--profile=<profile>` CLI flag when using the CLI. Let's take an example to load the `dev.env` profile file if it exists:

{{< command >}}
python -m localstack.cli.main --profile=dev start --host
{{< / command >}}

If no profile is specified, the `default.env` profile will be loaded. While explicitly specified, the environment variables will always overwrite the profile. 

To display the config environment variables, you can use the following command:

{{< command >}}
python -m localstack.cli.main --profile=dev config show
{{< / command >}}
