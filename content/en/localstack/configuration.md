  Environment variables which affect LocalStack.
---

LocalStack allows for many different configuration options.
You can pass these via environment variables, e.g., like the following:

{{< command >}}
$ SERVICES=kinesis,lambda,sqs,dynamodb DEBUG=1 localstack start
{{< / command >}}

## Core

## Local AWS Services

This section covers configuration values that are specific to AWS services.

* [DynamoDB]({{< ref "#dynamodb" >}})
* [Elasticsearch]({{< ref "#elasticsearch" >}})
* [Kinesis]({{< ref "#kinesis" >}})
* [Lambda]({{< ref "#lambda" >}})
* [Stepfunctions]({{< ref "#stepfunctions" >}})


### DynamoDB

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `DYNAMODB_ERROR_PROBABILITY` | Decimal value between `0.0`(default) and `1.0` | Randomly inject `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` errors into DynamoDB API responses. |
| `DYNAMODB_HEAP_SIZE` | `256m` (default), `1G` | Sets the JAVA EE maximum memory size for DynamoDB; full table scans require more memory |
| `DYNAMODB_SHARE_DB` | `0`\|`1` | When activated, DynamodDB will use a single database instead of separate databases for each credential and region. |
| `DYNAMODB_OPTIMIZE_DB_BEFORE_STARTUP` | `0`\|`1` | Optimize the database tables in the store before starting |
| `DYNAMODB_DELAY_TRANSIENT_STATUSES` | `0`\|`1` | When activated, DynamoDB will introduce artificial delays in resource creation to simulate the actual cloud service more closely. Currently works only for CREATING and DELETING online index statuses. |
| `DYNAMODB_CORS` | `*` | Enable CORS support for specific allow-list list the domains separated by `,` use `*` for public access (default is `*`) |


### Elasticsearch

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` | `http://elasticsearch:9200` | URL to a custom elasticsearch backend cluster. If this is set to a valid URL, then localstack will not create elasticsearch cluster instances, but instead forward all domains to the given backend (see [Elasticsearch#custom-elasticsearch-backends]({{< ref "elasticsearch#custom-elasticsearch-backends" >}})). |
| `ES_MULTI_CLUSTER` | `0`\|`1` | When activated, LocalStack will spawn one Elasticsearch cluster per domain. Otherwise all domains will share a single cluster instance. This is ignored if `ES_CUSTOM_BACKEND` is set. |
| `ES_ENDPOINT_STRATEGY` | `path`\|`domain`\|`off` | Governs how domain endpoints are created to access a cluster (see [Elasticsearch#endpoints]({{< ref "elasticsearch#endpoints" >}})) |


### Kinesis

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `KINESIS_ERROR_PROBABILITY` | Decimal value between `0.0`(default) and `1.0` | Randomly inject `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` errors into Kinesis API responses. |
| `KINESIS_SHARD_LIMIT` | `100` (default), `Infinity` (to disable) | Integer value , causing the Kinesis API to start throwing exceptions to mimick the default shard limit. |
| `KINESIS_LATENCY` | `500` (default), `0` (to disable)| Integer value of milliseconds, causing the Kinesis API to delay returning a response in order to mimick latency from a live AWS call. |
| `KINESIS_INITIALIZE_STREAMS` | `"my-first-stream:1,my-other-stream:2:us-west-2,my-last-stream:1"` | A comma-delimited string of stream names, its corresponding shard count and an optional region to initialize during startup. If the region is not provided, the default region is used. Only works with the `kinesis-mock` `KINESIS_PROVIDER`. |

### Lambda

| Variable| Example Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR` |  | Method to use for executing Lambda functions. For `docker` and `docker-reuse`, if LocalStack itself is started inside Docker, then the `docker` command needs to be available inside the container (usually requires to run the container in privileged mode). More information in [Lambda Executor Modes]({{< ref "lambda-executors" >}}). |
| | `docker` (default) | Run each function invocation in a separate Docker container. |
| | `local` (fallback) | Run Lambda functions in a temporary directory on the local machine. |
| | `docker-reuse` | Create one Docker container per function and reuse it across invocations. |
| `LAMBDA_STAY_OPEN_MODE` | `1` (default) | Usage of the [stay-open mode]({{< ref "lambda-executors#stay-open-mode" >}}) of Lambda containers. Only applicable if `LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=docker-reuse`. |
| `LAMBDA_REMOTE_DOCKER` | | determines whether Lambda code is copied or mounted into containers |
| | `true` (default) | your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by copying the zip file (potentially slower). It allows for remote execution, where the host and the client are not on the same machine.|
| | `false` | your Lambda function definitions will be passed to the container by mounting a volume (potentially faster). This requires to have the Docker client and the Docker host on the same machine. Also, `HOST_TMP_FOLDER` must be set properly, and a volume mount like `${HOST_TMP_FOLDER}:/tmp/localstack` needs to be configured if you're using docker-compose. |
| `BUCKET_MARKER_LOCAL` | | Optional bucket name for running lambdas locally.|
| `LAMBDA_CODE_EXTRACT_TIME` | `25` | Time in seconds to wait at max while extracting Lambda code. By default it is 25 seconds for limiting the execution time to avoid client/network timeout issues.| 
| `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK` | | Optional Docker network for the container running your lambda function. This configuration value also applies to ECS containers. |
| `LAMBDA_DOCKER_DNS` | | Optional DNS server for the container running your lambda function. |
| `LAMBDA_DOCKER_FLAGS` | `-e KEY=VALUE`, `-v host:container`, `-p host:container`, `--add-host domain:ip` | Additional flags passed to Lambda Docker `run`\|`create` commands (e.g., useful for specifying custom volume mounts). Does only support environment, volume, port and add-host flags |
| `LAMBDA_CONTAINER_REGISTRY` | `lambci/lambda` (default) | An alternative docker registry from where to pull lambda execution containers.|
| `LAMBDA_REMOVE_CONTAINERS` | `true` (default) | Whether to remove containers after Lambdas finished executing.|
| `LAMBDA_FALLBACK_URL` | | Fallback URL to use when a non-existing Lambda is invoked. Either records invocations in DynamoDB (value `dynamodb://<table_name>`) or forwards invocations as a POST request (value `http(s)://...`).|
| `LAMBDA_FORWARD_URL` | | URL used to forward all Lambda invocations (useful to run Lambdas via an external service).
| `LAMBDA_JAVA_OPTS` | `-Xmx512M` | Allow passing custom JVM options to Java Lambdas executed in Docker. Use `_debug_port_` placeholder to configure the debug port, e.g., `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=_debug_port_`. |
| `HOSTNAME_FROM_LAMBDA` | `localstack` | Endpoint host under which APIs are accessible from Lambda containers (optional). This can be useful in docker-compose stacks to use the local container hostname if neither IP address nor container name of the main container are available (e.g., in CI). Often used in combination with `LAMBDA_DOCKER_NETWORK`. |

### Stepfunction

| Variable | Example Values | Description |
