We regularly run the test suite of the Terraform AWS provider against LocalStack to test the compatibility of LocalStack to Terraform. To achieve that, we have a dedicated [GitHub action](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/master/.github/workflows/terraform-tests.yml) on [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), which executes the allow listed set of tests of [hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/).
