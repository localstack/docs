We regularly run the test suite of the Terraform AWS provider against LocalStack to test the compatibility of LocalStack to Terraform.
To that end we have a dedicated repository [localstack/localstack-terraform-test](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-terraform-test),
where you can also find instructions on how to run the tests.
