With LocalStack 1.0 we have introduced LocalStack Extensions that allow developers to extend and customize LocalStack. Both the feature and the API are currently experimental and may be subject to change.

## Using Extensions

Extensions are a LocalStack Pro feature. To use and install extensions, use the CLI to first log in to your account

```console
$ localstack login
Please provide your login credentials below
Username: ...
```

```console
$ localstack extensions --help

Usage: localstack extensions [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Manage LocalStack extensions (beta)

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  init       Initialize the LocalStack extensions environment
  install    Install a LocalStack extension
  uninstall  Remove a LocalStack extension
```

To install an extension, specify the name of the pip dependency that contains the extension. For example, for the official Stripe extension, you can either use the package distributed on pypi:


```console
$ localstack extensions install localstack-extensions-stripe
```

or you can install it directly from this git repository

```console
$ localstack extensions install "git+https://github.com/localstack/localstack-extensions/#egg=localstack-extensions-stripe&subdirectory=stripe"
```

## Developing Extensions

### The extensions API

LocalStack exposes a Python API for building extensions that can be found in the core codebase in [`localstack.extensions.api`](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/tree/master/localstack/extensions/api).

The basic interface to implement is as follows:

```python
class Extension(BaseExtension):
    """
    An extension that is loaded into LocalStack dynamically. The method
    execution order of an extension is as follows:

    - on_extension_load
    - on_platform_start
    - update_gateway_routes
    - update_request_handlers
    - update_response_handlers
    - on_platform_ready
    """

    namespace: str = "localstack.extensions"
    """The namespace of all basic localstack extensions."""

    name: str
    """The unique name of the extension set by the implementing class."""

    def on_extension_load(self):
        """
        Called when LocalStack loads the extension.
        """
        pass

    def on_platform_start(self):
        """
        Called when LocalStack starts the main runtime.
        """
        pass

    def update_gateway_routes(self, router: Router[RouteHandler]):
        """
        Called with the Router attached to the LocalStack gateway. Overwrite this to add or update routes.
        :param router: the Router attached in the gateway
        """
        pass

    def update_request_handlers(self, handlers: CompositeHandler):
        """
        Called with the custom request handlers of the LocalStack gateway. Overwrite this to add or update handlers.
        :param handlers: custom request handlers of the gateway
        """
        pass

    def update_response_handlers(self, handlers: CompositeResponseHandler):
        """
        Called with the custom response handlers of the LocalStack gateway. Overwrite this to add or update handlers.
        :param handlers: custom response handlers of the gateway
        """
        pass

    def on_platform_ready(self):
        """
        Called when LocalStack is ready and the Ready marker has been printed.
        """
        pass
```

A minimal example would look like this:

```python
import logging
from localstack.extensions.api import Extension

LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ReadyAnnoucerExtension(Extension):
    name = "my_ready_annoucer"

    def on_platform_ready(self):
    	LOG.info("my plugin is laded and localstack is ready to roll!")
```

### Package your Extension

Your extensions needs to be packaged as a Python distribution with a `setup.cfg` or `setup.py` config. LocalStack uses the [Plux](https://github.com/localstack/plux) code loading framework to load your code from a Python [entry point](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/).

You can either use Plux to discover the entrypoints from your code when
building and publishing your distribution, or manually define them as in the
example below.

A minimal `setup.cfg` for the extension above could look like this:

```ini
[metadata]
name = localstack-extension-ready-announcer
description = LocalStack extension that logs when LocalStack is ready to receive requests
author = Your Name
author_email = your@email.com
url = https://link-to-your-project

[options]
zip_safe = False
packages = find:
install_requires =
    localstack>=1.0.0

[options.entry_points]
localstack.extensions =
    my_ready_annoucer = localstack_annoucer.extension:ReadyAnnoucerExtension
```

The entry point group is the Plux namespace `locastack.extensions`, and the entry point name is the plugin name `my_ready_announcer`. The object reference points to the plugin class.
