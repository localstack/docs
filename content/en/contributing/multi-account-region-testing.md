  How to test multi-account and multi-region compatibility.

LocalStack supports multi-account and multi-region compatibility. 
This document describes how to test your changes for compatibility with cross-account and cross-region requests.

## Tips to make your changes compatible with multi-account and multi-region

In order to make your changes compatible with multi-account and multi-region, you should follow the below tips:

- For cross-account, in inter-service-communication for many integrations, you can specify a role, with which permissions the source service makes a request to the target service, to access another service's resource. 
This role should be in the source account.
When writing an AWS validated test case, you need to properly configure IAM roles.

    For example: 
    In the test case [`test_api_gateway_kinesis_integration`](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/0c2d8a103a9a06ade4ef1c18eacf5888d2b8adcf/tests/aws/services/apigateway/test_apigateway_basic.py#L2047) we have specified a [role](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/ae31f63bb6d8254edc0c85a66e3c36cd0c7dc7b0/tests/aws/services/apigateway/test_apigateway_basic.py#L2017-L2022) which has permissions to access the target kinesis account.
    ```python
    result = self.connect_api_gateway_to_kinesis(
            client,
            api_name,
            stream_name,
            region_name,
            role_arn,
        )
    ```

- While having an inter service communication in cross-account, you can create the client using `with_assumed_role(…)`:

    For example:
    ```python
    result = self.connect_api_gateway_to_kinesis(
            client,
            api_name,
            stream_name,
            region_name,
            role_arn,
        )
    ```
    
- When there is no role specified, you should use the source arn conceptually if cross-account is allowed. 

    For example:
    This can be seen in a case where we [added](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/ae31f63bb6d8254edc0c85a66e3c36cd0c7dc7b0/localstack/utils/aws/message_forwarding.py#L42) `account_id` to [send events to the target](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/ae31f63bb6d8254edc0c85a66e3c36cd0c7dc7b0/localstack/utils/aws/message_forwarding.py#L31) service like sqs, sns, lambda, etc. 

- You should always refer the official AWS API docs and check how the the application is communicating to each other. 
    
    For example: 
    Firehose to s3 refer to [Offical AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#cross-account-delivery-s3).


## Test changes in CI with non-default credentials

We regularly run the CircleCI test jobs of the LocalStack repository to check the compatibility of cross-account against the changes. 
To achieve that, we have a [scheduled workflow](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) on [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), which executes the tests with randomized account and region credentials every night at 1:00am UTC.

To manually trigger the workflow through the webinterface of CircleCI (in case you have the permissions), in order to test your changes with randomized account and region credentials, you can perform the following steps: 
- Go to the [localStack](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack) project repository on CircleCI.
- Select a branch for which you want to trigger the workflow from the filters section.
- Now click on the `Trigger pipeline` button on the right and add the following variables:
    1. Parameter type to `string`
    2. Name to `randomize-aws-credentials`
    3. Value to `true`
- Press the `Trigger pipeline` button to trigger the workflow.

## Test changes locally with non-default credentials

In order to test your changes on your machine for multi-account and multi-region compatibility in case you have the permissions, i.e. for non-default values other than `000000000000` for account ID or `us-east-1` for region, set the following environment variables to any random non-default values, for example:  

- `TEST_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=111111111111`
- `TEST_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=111111111111`
- `TEST_AWS_REGION=us-west-1`
- `TEST_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test1`

You can additionally prefer to create a commit eg: [da3f8d5](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9751/commits/da3f8d5f2328adb7c5c025722994fea4433c08ba) to test the pipeline for non-default credentials against your changes. 
Note that within the tests we must use `account_id`, `secondary_account_id`, `region_name`, `secondary_region_name` fixtures and avoid importing `localstack.constants.TEST_*` values.
