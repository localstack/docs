  Use LocalStack in CircleCI
---

## Introduction

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform which uses a configuration file (usually named `.circleci/config.yml`) to define the build, test, and deployment workflows. LocalStack supports CircleCI out of the box and can be easily integrated into your pipeline to run your tests against a local cloud emulator.

## Getting started

This guide is designed for users new to CircleCI and assumes basic knowledge of YAML and LocalStack tooling. To create a CircleCI job that uses LocalStack, follow these steps:

- Under the "Projects" tab, find your project and click "Set Up Project"
- You'll be prompted to add a configuration. You can add the configuration manually or choose a starter pipeline.
- If you choose the starter CI pipeline, a sample `config.yml` file is created and committed to a `circleci-project-setup` branch in your repo.
- You can add the following configuration to the `config.yml` file to start LocalStack and run your tests against it.

```yml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  python: circleci/python@2.0.3

jobs:
  example-job:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-2004:2022.04.1

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run:
          name: Start LocalStack
          command: |
            pip3 install localstack awscli-local[ver1]
            docker pull localstack/localstack
            localstack start -d                     

            echo "Waiting for LocalStack startup..."  
            localstack wait -t 30                     
            echo "Startup complete"
            
      - run:
          name: Run AWS CLI commands against LocalStack
          command: |
            awslocal s3 mb s3://test-bucket
            awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name test-queue
            awslocal sns create-topic --name test-topic

workflows:
  version: 2
  build:
    jobs:
      - example-job
```

The above CircleCI job does the following:

- Defines a job called `example-job` that installs the `localstack` CLI and `awslocal` wrapper script to execute AWS CLI commands against LocalStack.
- Pulls the LocalStack Docker image depending on the product tier via the `localstack` CLI (For Community, the image is `localstack/localstack`, while for Pro it is `localstack/localstack-pro`).
- Starts LocalStack in the background and waits for it to become ready. After 30 seconds, the job will execute basic AWS CLI commands against LocalStack.

## Configuring a CI key

To enable LocalStack Pro+, you need to add your LocalStack CI API key to the project's environment variables. The LocalStack container will automatically pick it up and activate the licensed features. 

Go to the [CI Key Page](https://app.localstack.cloud/workspace/ci-keys) page and copy your CI key. To add the CI key to your CircleCI project, follow these steps:

- Click on **Project Settings**.
- Select **Environment Variables** from the left side menu.
- Click **Add Environment Variable**.
- Name your environment variable `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY`.
- Paste your CI key into the input field.
