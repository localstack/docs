  Use LocalStack in [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)
---

This guide shows how to start and use LocalStack in your Travis CI jobs.

## Setting up the Travis CI job

When you want to integrate LocalStack into your job configuration, you just have to execute the following steps:
- Install the LocalStack CLI (and maybe also `awslocal`).
- Make sure your LocalStack docker image is up-to-date by pulling the latest version.
- Use the LocalStack CLI to start LocalStack.
  Make sure to use the `-d` flag to start the LocalStack docker container in detached mode.
- Wait for the container to report that it is up and running.

The following example Travis CI job config (`.travis.yaml`) executes these steps, creates a new S3 bucket, and prints a nice message in the end:

```yaml
language: python

services:
    - docker

python:
  - "3.8"

before_install:
  # Install the LocalStack CLI and awslocal
  - python -m pip install localstack awscli-local[ver1]
  # Make sure to pull the latest version of the image
  - docker pull localstack/localstack
  # Start LocalStack in the background
  - localstack start -d
  # Wait 30 seconds for the LocalStack container to become ready before timing out
  - echo "Waiting for LocalStack startup..."
  - localstack wait -t 30
  - echo "Startup complete"

script:
  # Test LocalStack by creating a new S3 bucket (and verify that it has been created by listing all buckets)
  - awslocal s3 mb s3://test
  - awslocal s3 ls
  - echo "Execute your tests here :)"
```

## Configuring a CI Auth Token

You can easily enable LocalStack Pro by using the `localstack/localstack-pro` image and adding your [CI Auth Token](https://app.localstack.cloud/workspace/auth-tokens) to the project's environment variables as `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN`.
The LocalStack CLI will automatically detect it and activate the Pro features.

To configure this in Travis CI, go to the project settings (`More options` â†’ `Settings`), scroll down to the `Environment Variables` section, and add your CI Auth Token as `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Here is an example workflow:

```yaml
before_install:
  # Install the LocalStack CLI and awslocal
  - python -m pip install localstack awscli-local[ver1]
  # Make sure to pull the latest version of the image
  - docker pull localstack/localstack-pro
  # Start LocalStack in the background
  - localstack start -d
  # Wait 30 seconds for the LocalStack container to become ready before timing out
  - echo "Waiting for LocalStack startup..."
  - localstack wait -t 30
  - echo "Startup complete"
```
