## Introduction

LocalStack Deployments allow you to run an LocalStack instance in the cloud. LocalStack Deployments encompasses the following features:

- Deploy LocalStack as a cloud sandbox for dev&test loops without running it locally.
- Create easy previews by enabling preview-per-PR type workflows for application change.
- Facilitate collaboration by allowing developers to test features on the same environment.
