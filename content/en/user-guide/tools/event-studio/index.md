## Introduction

Event Studio allows users to view, collect, and inspect data exchanges, including event payloads and metadata, between AWS services.
It enhances system observability by displaying the data exchanged at every stage, facilitating clear understanding of event flows.
It further centralizes debugging by enabling event replay at any system stage for detailed analysis and troubleshooting.
In addition, it serves as a single point of truth to understand potential errors, service configuration mismatches and IAM permission issues.

With Event Studio, you can:

- Observe and understand the flow of events through your system.
- Replay events to troubleshoot AWS services involved in your workflow.
- Identify errors and obtain detailed information for corrections.
- Get immediate feedback on any misconfigurations in your services.
- Gain insights into IAM policies and detect missing permissions.
- Enhance event contexts for advanced flow tracing.

## Installation

To install Event Studio, start your LocalStack container with your `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN`:

{{< command >}}
$ export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=...
$ localstack start
{{< / command >}}

Event Studio is available as a LocalStack Extension.
To install it, use the `extensions` sub-command in the `localstack` CLI.
Run the following command to install Event Studio:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack extensions install localstack-extension-event-studio
{{< / command >}}

Check the LocalStack logs for Event Studio output, where you should see logs like:

```bash
localstack-main  | 2024-11-21T08:47:25.688  INFO --- [  MainThread] l.e.patterns.webapp        : eventstudio extension available at http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_extension/eventstudio
localstack-main  | 2024-11-21T08:47:25.694  INFO --- [  MainThread] l.e.patterns.webapp        : eventstudio extension available at http://eventstudio.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566
localstack-main  | 2024-11-21T08:47:25.858  INFO --- [ady_monitor)] eventstudio.extension      : Extension Loaded
localstack-main  | Ready.
```

You can navigate to **https://eventstudio.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566** in your browser to view your events.
