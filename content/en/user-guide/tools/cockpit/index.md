## Features

The LocalStack Cockpit makes it easy for you to manage your LocalStack instance.
Here are some of the Cockpit's features:

### Automatic environment check

When the Cockpit starts it will automatically check your system environment whether everything is ready to start LocalStack.
It will also download the LocalStack Docker image for you, should it not be on your system.
