## Features

Currently, the LocalStack Extension for Docker Desktop supports the following features:

* **Control LocalStack**: Start, stop, and restart LocalStack from the Docker Desktop. You can also see the current status of your LocalStack instance and navigate to LocalStack Web Application.
* **LocalStack insights**: You can see the log information of the LocalStack instance and all the available services and their status on the service page.
* **LocalStack configurations**: You can manage and use your profiles via configurations and create new configurations for your LocalStack instance.

We also recommend you to add add `/tmp` to your shared files on Docker Desktop under **Settings** > **Resources** > **File sharing**. It is a temporary solution since it's where the LocalStack volume directory mounts.
