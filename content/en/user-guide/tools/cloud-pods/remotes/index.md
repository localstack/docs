{{< alert title="Beta">}}
Cloud Pod Remotes is a feature that is currently in beta (available in the Team product tier).
{{< /alert >}}

A remote is the place where your Cloud Pods are stored.
By default, we store the Cloud Pods' artifacts in the LocalStack platform.
Although we provide the highest levels of security and isolation (incl. encryption in transit and at rest), there may be situations (e.g., due to data regulation and sovereignty) where your organization does not permit storing Cloud Pod assets in a remote storage infrastructure. 
Hence, you may want to persist Cloud Pods in a different storage location that is on-premise and fully under your control.

We currently offer two alternative types of remotes:
- S3 bucket remote storage;
- [ORAS](https://oras.land/) (OCI Registry as Storage) remote storage.

Our Cloud Pods command-line interface (CLI) has been expanded and now offers commands to create, delete, and list remotes:

```bash
localstack pod remote --help
Usage: localstack pod remote [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Manage cloud pod remotes

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add     Add a remote
  delete  Delete a remote
  list    List the available remotes
```

## S3 bucket remote storage
The S3 remote lets you store Cloud Pods assets into an existing S3 bucket in a real AWS account.
The first step is to export proper AWS credentials in the terminal session.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

A possible option is to obtain credentials via [AWS SSO CLI](https://github.com/synfinatic/aws-sso-cli).

Afterwards, we add a new remote that explicitly targets an S3 bucket.
With the command below, we are creating a new remote called `s3-storage-aws` that will store the Cloud Pods' artifacts into an S3 bucket named `ls-pods-bucket-test`.
The `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` placeholders will make sure that the AWS credentials are correctly passed to the container.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod remote add s3-storage-aws 's3://ls-pods-bucket-test/?access_key_id={access_key_id}&secret_access_key={secret_access_key}'
{{< / command >}}

Finally, we can use the usual `pod` CLI command to create a new pod that targets the created remote.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod save my-pod s3-storage-aws
{{< / command >}}

After issuing the command, we can verify that the S3 buckets now contains the pod artifacts by simply running:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://ls-pods-bucket-test
2023-09-27 13:50:10      83650 localstack-pod-my-pod-state-1.zip
2023-09-27 13:50:11      85103 localstack-pod-my-pod-version-1.zip
```

With the `pod load` command we can later load the same pod saved into this remote:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod load my-pod s3-storage-aws
{{< / command >}}

## ORAS remote storage
The ORAS remote allows users to save Cloud Pods in OCI-compatible registries such as Docker Hub, Nexus, or ECS registries.
ORAS is an acronym for _OCI Registry as Service_ - more details about this standard can be found [here](https://oras.land/).

As an example, let us demonstrate how it is possible to leverage Docker Hub to store and retrieve Cloud Pods.

At first, we need to configure the new remote with the LocalStack CLI.
We are going to export two environment variables, `ORAS_USERNAME` and `ORAS_PASSWORD` that are needed to authenticate with DockerHub.

```bash
export ORAS_USERNAME=docker_hub_id
export ORAS_PASSWORD=ILoveLocalStack1!
```

Then, I can use the CLI to create a new remote called `oras-remote`.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod remote add oras-remote 'oras://{oras_username}:{oras_password}@registry.hub.docker.com/<docker_hub_id>'
{{< / command >}}

Finally, we can save a pod with the just-configured remote, where `my-pod` is the name of the Cloud Pod while `oras-remote` is the name of the remote itself.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod save my-pod oras-remote
{{< / command >}}

Similarly, we can perform the reverse operation and load a Cloud Pod from `oras-remote` with the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod load my-pod oras-remote
{{< / command >}}

### Miscellaneous
If not explicitly specified, all Cloud Pods commands target the LocalStack Platform as storage remote by default. 
Please note that the CLI needs to be properly authenticated against our Platform, and a Team/Enterprise subscription is required.

The configurations for custom remotes are saved inside the [LocalStack volume directory](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/filesystem/#localstack-volume-directory) and maintained by the LocalStack container itself.
Therefore, if you want to share Cloud Pods within your team using a custom remote, each team member would need to define the same remote configuration.
Once added, a remote is persisted across LocalStack restarts.
