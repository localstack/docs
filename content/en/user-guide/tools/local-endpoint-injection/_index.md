  Transparently inject local endpoints into AWS SDKs and redirect your AWS calls to LocalStack

In the community (open source) edition, the application code needs to configure each AWS SDK client instance with the target `endpoint URL` to point to the APIs on `localhost` or, in the case of Lambdas running in the context of LocalStack, the `endpoint URL` should point to `http://${LOCALSTACK_HOSTNAME}:${EDGE_PORT}`.

The Pro version provides two options for transparently making your application logic speak to the local APIs instead of real AWS (without having to change your production code):
1. integrated DNS server
2. patched AWS SDKs

More details can be found in the subsections below.
