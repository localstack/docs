## Introduction

Enterprise support offers organizations personalized resources, direct communication channels with the LocalStack team, and flexible service level agreements (SLAs) to meet specific business requirements.
The key components of our enterprise support offering include:

- **Direct Slack Connect Channel**: A dedicated Slack Connect channel is available to maintain a direct communication link with the LocalStack engineering team.
  This setup ensures quick issue resolution and streamlined collaboration, improving overall service efficiency.
- **Dedicated Customer Success Manager (CSM) and Solutions Architect (SA)**: Enterprise customers are assigned a CSM and SA.
  The CSM acts as a strategic advisor to help fully utilize LocalStack's offerings, while the SA provides expert technical assistance in designing and optimizing solutions tailored to your needs.
- **Custom Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Tailor your service levels and response times to meet your organization's requirements.
  Custom SLAs can be negotiated to align with your business objectives and ensure optimal system performance.
- **Support Ticketing Portal**: Access the [support ticketing portal](https://support.localstack.cloud/portal) to view, create, and respond to support tickets, ensuring organized tracking of all queries.
- **Real-time Chat Support**: Real-time Level 1 (L1) chat support is available during support operating hours.
  While immediate resolutions are prioritized, complex issues may require additional time and resources for thorough handling.

## Customer portal

A customer portal is a home behind a login where customers can view, open, and reply to their support tickets.
Currently, the **customer portal** is only **available to Enterprise customers**.

You can find the customer portal here: [https://support.localstack.cloud/portal](https://support.localstack.cloud/portal)
