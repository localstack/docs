## Introduction

A customer portal is a home behind a login where customers can view, open, and reply to their support tickets. Currently, the **customer portal** is only **available to Enterprise customers**.

You can find the customer portal here: [https://support.localstack.cloud/portal](https://support.localstack.cloud/portal)

## Signing up for Enterprise Support

If you are a member of an organization with an enterprise LocalStack subscription, you will receive an invitation to create an account and join the LocalStack Support Portal via email.

Follow the instructions in the email and set up your account by clicking on the **Sign up** button. You will be asked to create a password. Once you do so, you will be able to log in and start using the customer portal to create, view, and engage with tickets.

## Creating a Support Ticket

You can open a new ticket with LocalStack support by going to the **Create a Support Ticket** link. You will be redirected to a form where you will have to provide certain information to file a new support ticket.

</p>

The form consists of two parts. One is basic information, which is mandatory to fill out, and additional information, which adds more context to your issue but is not mandatory. Once all the mandatory fields are filled out, you can create a new support ticket by clicking on the Submit button. Once the ticket is submitted, it will be reported to LocalStack support, who will get back to you on that query as soon as possible. A ticket will show up in the ticket list as soon as it’s submitted.

### Basic Information

You need to fill out the following fields, which are mandatory to open a new ticket:

    -   **Issue** - Select this when you are facing an issue using LocalStack.
    -   **General inquiry** - Select this when you have a general question regarding LocalStack.
    -   **Feature request** - Select this when you are looking for a feature that is not yet implemented in LocalStack.
-   **Ticket name** - Provide a descriptive name for the ticket that summarizes your inquiry.
-   **Description** - Provide a comprehensive description of your inquiry, explaining all the details that will help us understand your query.

### Additional Information
