## Introduction

## EC2 Kubernetes Executor

The LocalStack Enterprise image allows you to run EC2 instances on Kubernetes.
You can do so by setting the `EC2_VM_MANAGER` environment variable to `kubernetes` in the LocalStack container.
Each EC2 instance in the Kubernetes VM manager is backed by a Pod.

The following operations are supported:

| Operation            | Notes                                  |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `DescribeInstances`  | Returns all EC2 instances              |
| `RunInstances`       | Defines and starts an EC2 instance     |
| `StartInstances`     | Starts an already defined EC2 instance |
| `StopInstances`      | Stops a running EC2 instance           |
| `TerminateInstances` | Stops and undefines a EC2 instance     |

The current implementation is in preview and does not support volumes, custom AMIs, or networking features available in other VM managers.

## ECS Kubernetes Executor

LocalStack Enterprise image allows you to run ECS tasks on Kubernetes.
The tasks are added to ELB load balancer target groups.
You can do so by setting the `ECS_TASK_EXECUTOR` environment variable to `kubernetes` in the LocalStack container.

## Lambda Kubernetes Executor

The LocalStack Enterprise image allows you to execute Lambda functions as Kubernetes pods.
You can do so by setting the `lambda.executor` configuration to `kubernetes` in the LocalStack container.
For more information, see the [Helm Chart configuration](https://github.com/localstack/helm-charts/blob/ce47b1590605901650ab788556bc871efbd78b8d/charts/localstack/values.yaml#L178-L208).

- Kubernetes Lambda Executor in LocalStack scales Lambda execution by spawning new environments (running in pods) during concurrent invocations.
  Inactive environments shut down after 10 minutes (configurable via `LAMBDA_KEEPALIVE_MS`).
- Executor schedules multiple Lambda functions according to Kubernetes cluster defaults without specifying node affinity.
  Users can assign labels to lambda pods using the `LAMBDA_K8S_LABELS` variable (e.g., `LAMBDA_K8S_LABELS=key=value,key2=value2`).
- Timeout configurations similar to AWS are enforced using the `Timeout` function parameter.
  No intrinsic limits on the number of Lambdas; default limit on concurrent executions is 1000 (`LAMBDA_LIMITS_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS`).
- Custom DNS configuration for Lambda on Kubernetes can be set through the `LAMBDA_DOCKER_DNS` configuration variable.
- Users can customize Lambda runtime behavior by building custom images, pushing them to their registry, and specifying these images using the `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_IMAGE_MAPPING` configuration variable.
- Lambda on Kubernetes supports Warm Start and Persistence.
  Persistence must be configured for the LocalStack pod.
  The `/var/lib/localstack` directory should be persisted over LocalStack runs, typically in a volume.

Lambda hot reloading & remote debugging are not supported in the Kubernetes executor as the bind mounting into pods cannot be done at runtime.
