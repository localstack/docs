## Introduction

LocalStack offers an Enterprise image that allows offline usage and includes a customer-specific configuration.
This offline functionality is enabled by:

- Pre-installed packages required for running specific services that are usually downloaded on demand (such as `opensearch` or `dynamodb-local`).
- A certificate keypair for `localhost.localstack.cloud` to resolve to the LocalStack container via our DNS server.
- An embedded decryption key in the image, eliminating the need to contact the license server to operate LocalStack.

## Why use Enterprise Image?

- **Airgapped environments**: The Enterprise image is ideal for customers who operate in airgapped environments where internet access is restricted.
- **Security Fixes**: The Enterprise image is updated with the latest security fixes and patches including container image scans on a priority basis.
- **Custom Configuration**: The Enterprise image can be customized to include specific packages and configurations required by the customer.
- **CI Usage**: The Enterprise image can be used in CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the same image is used across all environments.

## How to use the image?

- After the image is pushed to the customer-specific ECR repository, the customer can pull and push it to their internal Docker registry.
- Developers within the customerâ€™s network can then pull the image from this registry.
- To use the image from the command line interface (CLI), set the `IMAGE_NAME` configuration to the name of the Enterprise image, typically using the command:
    {{< command >}}
    $ IMAGE_NAME=localstack-enterprise localstack start
    {{< / command >}}
