## Introduction

CodeDeploy is a service that automates application deployments.
On AWS, it supports deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.
Furthermore, based on the target it is also possible to use an in-place deployment or a blue/green deployment.

LocalStack supports a mocking of CodeDeploy API operations.
The supported operations are listed on the [API coverage page]({{< ref "coverage_codedeploy" >}}).
