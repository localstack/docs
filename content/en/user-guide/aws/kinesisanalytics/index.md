## Introduction

Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to process and analyze streaming data in real-time.
It allows you to apply transformations, filtering, and enrichment to streaming data using standard SQL syntax.

LocalStack allows you to use the Kinesis Data Analytics APIs in your local environment.
The API coverage is available on:

* [Kinesis Data Analytics](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/coverage_kinesisanalytics/)

## Getting started

This guide is designed for users new to Kinesis Data Analytics and assumes basic knowledge of the AWS CLI and our [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local) wrapper script.

Start your LocalStack container using your preferred method.
We will demonstrate how to create a Kinesis Analytics application using AWS CLI.

### Create an application

You can create a Kinesis Analytics application using the [`CreateApplication`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_CreateApplication.html) API by running the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal kinesisanalytics create-application \
    --application-name test-analytics-app
{{< /command >}}

The following output would be retrieved:

```bash
{
    "ApplicationSummary": {
        "ApplicationName": "test-analytics-app",
        "ApplicationARN": "arn:aws:kinesisanalytics:us-east-1:000000000000:application/test-analytics-app",
        "ApplicationStatus": "READY"
    }
}
```

### Describe the application

You can describe the application using the [`DescribeApplication`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeApplication.html) API by running the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal kinesisanalytics describe-application \
    --application-name test-analytics-app
{{< /command >}}

The following output would be retrieved:

```bash
{
    "ApplicationDetail": {
        "ApplicationName": "test-analytics-app",
        "ApplicationARN": "arn:aws:kinesisanalytics:us-east-1:000000000000:application/test-analytics-app",
        "ApplicationStatus": "READY",
        "CreateTimestamp": 1718194721.567,
        "InputDescriptions": [],
        "OutputDescriptions": [],
        "ReferenceDataSourceDescriptions": [],
        "CloudWatchLoggingOptionDescriptions": [],
        "ApplicationVersionId": 1
    }
}
```

### Tag the application

Add tags to the application using the [`TagResource`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) API by running the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal kinesisanalytics tag-resource \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:kinesisanalytics:us-east-1:000000000000:application/test-analytics-app \
    --tags Key=test,Value=test
{{< /command >}}

You can list the tags for the application using the [`ListTagsForResource`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_ListTagsForResource.html) API by running the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal kinesisanalytics list-tags-for-resource \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:kinesisanalytics:us-east-1:000000000000:application/test-analytics-app
{{< /command >}}

The following output would be retrieved:

```bash
{
    "Tags": [
        {
            "Key": "test",
            "Value": "test"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Limitations

* LocalStack supports basic emulation for Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications.
  However, the queries are not fully supported and lack parity with AWS.
