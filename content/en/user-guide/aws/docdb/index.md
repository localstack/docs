    Get started with AWS DocumentDB on LocalStack
---

LocalStack Pro supports a basic version of [Amazon DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) for testing.
LocalStack starts a MongoDB server, to handle DocumentDB storage, in a separate Docker container and adds port-mapping so that it
can be accessed from localhost. When defining a port to access the container, an available port on the host machine will be selected, that means there
is no pre-defined port range.
By default, a master user named `test` will be instantiated without a password.

{{< alert title="Information" color="success">}}
MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance for modern application development.
It belongs to the family of
non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases.
{{< /alert>}}

DocumentDB currently uses the default configuration of the
latest [MongoDB Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo). It automatically creates a database
named `test` upon cluster creation.


{{< alert title="Note" >}}
Because LocalStack utilizes a MongoDB container to provide DocumentDB storage, LocalStack may not
have exact feature parity with Amazon DocumentDB. The database engine may support additional
features that
Amazon DocumentDB does not and vice versa.
{{< /alert >}}

## Getting started

To create a new DocumentDB cluster we use the `create-db-cluster` command as follows:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal docdb create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier test-docdb-cluster --engine docdb
{{< /command >}}

```yaml
{
  "DBCluster": {
    "DBClusterIdentifier": "test-docdb-cluster",
    "DBClusterParameterGroup": "default.docdb",
    "Status": "available",
    "Endpoint": "localhost:39045",
    "MultiAZ": false,
    "Engine": "docdb",
    "Port": 39045,
    "MasterUsername": "test",
    "DBClusterMembers": [],
    "VpcSecurityGroups": [
      {
        "VpcSecurityGroupId": "sg-a30edea1f7da6ff90",
        "Status": "active"
      }
    ],
    "StorageEncrypted": false,
    "DBClusterArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:000000000000:cluster:test-docdb-cluster"
  }
}
```

If we break down the previous command, we can identify:

- `docdb`: The command related to Amazon DocumentDB for the `AWS CLI`.
- `create-db-cluster`: The command to create an Amazon DocumentDB cluster.
- `--db-cluster-identifier test-docdb-cluster`: Specifies the unique identifier for the DocumentDB
  cluster. In this case, it is set to `test-docdb-cluster`. You can customize this identifier to a
  name of your choice.
- `--engine docdb`: Specifies the database engine. Here, it is set to `docdb`, indicating the use of
  Amazon DocumentDB.

Notice in the `DBClusterMembers` field of the cluster description that there are no other databases
created.
To create a new database, we can use the `create-db-instance` command, like in this example:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal docdb create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier test-company
--db-instance-class db.r5.large --engine docdb --db-cluster-identifier test-docdb-cluster
{{< /command >}}
```yaml
{
  "DBInstance": {
    "DBInstanceIdentifier": "test-docdb-instance",
    "DBInstanceClass": "db.r5.large",
    "Engine": "docdb",
    "DBInstanceStatus": "creating",
    "Endpoint": {
      "Address": "localhost",
      "Port": 50761
    },
    "InstanceCreateTime": "2022-10-28T04:27:35.917000+00:00",
    "PreferredBackupWindow": "03:50-04:20",
    "BackupRetentionPeriod": 1,
    "VpcSecurityGroups": [ ,
      "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1a",
      "PreferredMaintenanceWindow": "wed:06:38-wed:07:08",
      "EngineVersion": "12.34",
      "AutoMinorVersionUpgrade": false,
      "PubliclyAccessible": false,
      "StatusInfos": [],
      "DBClusterIdentifier": "test-docdb-cluster",
      "StorageEncrypted": false,
      "DbiResourceId": "db-M5ENSHXFPU6XHZ4G4ZEI5QIO2U",
      "CopyTagsToSnapshot": false,
      "DBInstanceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:000000000000:db:test-docdb-instance",
      "EnabledCloudwatchLogsExports": []
      }
      }
```

Some noticeable fields:

- `--db-instance-identifier test-company`: Represents the unique identifier of the newly created
  database.
- `--db-instance-class db.r5.large`: Is the type or class of the Amazon DocumentDB
  instance. It determines the compute and memory capacity allocated to the instance. `db.r5.large` refers to a specific instance type in
  the R5 family. Although the flag is required for database creation, LocalStack will only mock the `DBInstanceClass` attribute.

  You can find out more about instance classes in
  the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html)
  .

To obtain detailed information about the cluster, we use the `describe-db-cluster` command:
{{< command >}}
$ awslocal docdb describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier test-docdb-cluster
{{< /command >}}

```yaml
{
  "DBClusters": [
    {
      "DBClusterIdentifier": "test-docdb-cluster",
      "DBClusterParameterGroup": "default.docdb",
      "Status": "available",
      "Endpoint": "localhost:39045",
      "MultiAZ": false,
      "Engine": "docdb",
      "Port": 39045,
      "MasterUsername": "test",
      "DBClusterMembers": [
        {
          "DBInstanceIdentifier": "test-company",
          "IsClusterWriter": true,
          "DBClusterParameterGroupStatus": "in-sync",
          "PromotionTier": 1
        }
      ],
      "VpcSecurityGroups": [
        {
          "VpcSecurityGroupId": "sg-a30edea1f7da6ff90",
          "Status": "active"
        }
      ],
      "StorageEncrypted": false,
      "DBClusterArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:000000000000:cluster:test-docdb-cluster"
    }
  ]
}
```

Interacting with the databases is done using `mongosh`, which is an official command-line shell and
interactive MongoDB shell provided by MongoDB.
It is designed to provide a modern and enhanced user experience for interacting with MongoDB
databases.

{{< command >}}

$ mongosh mongodb://localhost:39045
Current Mongosh Log ID:    64a70b795697bcd4865e1b9a
Connecting to:        mongodb://localhost:
39045/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+1.10.1
Using MongoDB:        6.0.7
Using Mongosh:        1.10.1

For mongosh info see: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/

------

test>

{{< /command >}}

This command will default to accessing the `test` database that was created with the cluster. Notice the port, `39045`,
which is the cluster port that appears in the aforementioned description.

To work with a specific database, the command is:

{{< command >}}
$ mongosh mongodb://localhost:39045/test-company
Current Mongosh Log ID:    64a71916fae7fdeeb8b43a73
Connecting to:        mongodb://localhost:
39045/test-company?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+1.10.1
Using MongoDB:        6.0.7
Using Mongosh:        1.10.1

For mongosh info see: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/

------
test-company>

{{< /command >}}

From here on we can manipulate collections
using [the JavaScript methods provided](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)
by `mongosh`:

{{< command >}}

test-company> db.createCollection("employees")
{ ok: 1 }
test-company> db.createCollection("customers")
{ ok: 1 }
test-company> show collections
customers
employees
test-company> exit

{{< /command >}}

For more information on how to use MongoDB with `mongosh` please refer to
the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).
