## Introduction

The Chaos Engineering Dashboard in LocalStack offers streamlined testing for cloud applications, enabling you to simulate server errors, service outages, regional disruptions, and network latency with ease, ensuring your app is ready for real-world challenges.

The dashboard uses [LocalStack Chaos API]({{< ref "chaos-api" >}}) under the hood to offer a set of customizable templates that can be seamlessly integrated into any automation workflows.

## Features

The dashboard offers the following features:

* **DynamoDB Error**: Randomly inject `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` errors into DynamoDB API responses.
* **Kinesis Error**: Randomly inject `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` errors into Kinesis API responses.
* **500 Internal Error**: Randomly terminate incoming requests, returning an `Internal Server Error` with a response code of 500.
* **Service Unavailable**: Cause a specified percentage of service API calls to receive a 503 `Service Unavailable` response.
* **AWS Region Unavailable**: Simulate regional outages and failovers by disabling entire AWS regions.
* **Latency**: Introduce specified latency to every API call, useful for simulating network latency or degraded network performance.
