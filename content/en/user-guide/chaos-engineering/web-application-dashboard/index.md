## Introduction

LocalStack's Chaos Engineering dashboard offers streamlined testing for cloud applications, enabling you to simulate server
errors, service outages, regional disruptions, and network latency with ease, ensuring your app is ready for real-world challenges.
You can find this **Pro** feature in the web app by navigating to [**app.localstack.cloud/chaos-engineering**](https://app.localstack.cloud/chaos-engineering).

## Web Application FIS Dashboard

LocalStack Web Application provides a dashboard for conducting FIS experiments in user stacks. This control panel offers various FIS experiment options, which includes:

-   **500 Internal Error**: This experiment randomly terminates incoming requests, returning an `Internal Server Error` with a response code of 500.
-   **Service Unavailable**: This test causes all calls to specified services to receive a 503 `Service Unavailable` response.
-   **AWS Region Unavailable**: This experiment simulates regional outages and failovers by disabling entire AWS regions.
-   **Latency**: This test introduces specified latency to every API call, useful for simulating network latency or degraded network performance.

This LocalStack dashboard is not just an easy-to-use testing tool, it's a foundation for building reusable Fault Injection
Simulation (FIS) templates. By defining experiments using this interface, you create a set of 
customizable templates that can be seamlessly integrated into any future automation workflows. It's a time-saving 
feature, ensuring consistent and efficient testing across various stages of your application's development lifecycle.
