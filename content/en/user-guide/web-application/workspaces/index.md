In LocalStack, a workspace allows you to collaborate with members of your organization and it encapsulates user and license management, subscriptions and billing, as well as access to shared resources and features like Cloud Pods or Stack Insights.

A workspace represents the base organizational unit in the web application.
Users can be invited to join a workspace, and an admin can manage their license and permissions inside a workspace.
