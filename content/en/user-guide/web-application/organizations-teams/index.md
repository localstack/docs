### Organizations / Teams
<i>The terms 'Organization' and 'Team' are used interchangeably within our web application</i><br>
<br>
Both [individual and company accounts]({{< ref "accounts#individual-account--company-account" >}}) are able to invite other accounts into their teams.<br>
Accounts that are invited into a team can also be given advanced role settings by the team admin, 
such as purchasing subscriptions, managing payment methods, and more.
<br>Teams offer an easy way to manage subscriptions and API keys for multiple individual users.
For example, you can purchase a plan with multiple seats for your team, which allows you to distribute the API keys among your team members.

#### Inviting Team Members
To invite team members, navigate to the [`Team Members`](https://app.localstack.cloud/account/members) section of your profile.<br>
Enter the user name and the email address of a team member, and click on the plus symbol (`+`) to invite them to your team.

#### Adjusting Member Roles and assigning API Keys

Once your team member has been invited, you can click on them to adjust their roles, permissions, and assign an API key to them.<br>
This will allow them to access their own API key in the [`API Keys`](https://app.localstack.cloud/account/apikeys) section of their profile.
