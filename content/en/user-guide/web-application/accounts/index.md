A LocalStack account is a requirement to get your LocalStack licenses and API keys, which allow you to use advanced features of LocalStack, such as LocalStack Pro services, [Stack Insights]({{< ref "stack-insights" >}}), [Cloud Pods]({{< ref "cloud-pods" >}}), and more!<br><br>
To create an account for LocalStack, please visit our [web application](https://app.localstack.cloud/sign-up).<br>
When signing up for an account, you can either do so by providing an email address, or by signing up with one of our social identity providers (such as GitHub).

### Individual Account / Company Account
After successfully signing up for a LocalStack, you will end up with an <b>individual account</b>.
These accounts are intended for non-company entities, such as sole developers.<br>
Within the [profile](https://app.localstack.cloud/account) section of your account, you will find a toggle to switch to a <b>company account</b> instead.
This will allow you to add more information about your organization, such as `Company Name`, `Country` and `Tax ID`, which should be set if you are acting on behalf of a company.
