## Account Types

You can choose between an **individual account** or a **company account**. When you sign up for LocalStack, you will automatically sign up for an individual account. These accounts are intended for non-company entities, such as individual developers.

To switch to a company account, you can do so from your [**app.localstack.cloud/account**](https://app.localstack.cloud/account) section. Click on the toggle to switch to a company account. You will be prompted to add the following information about your organization:

- Company Name
- Country
- Tax ID

The above information is required if you are acting on behalf of a company.
