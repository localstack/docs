  Get started with LocalStack extensions by installing and using the official MailHog extension.
---

## Introduction

MailHog is an open source email testing tool for developers. It provides a simple SMTP server and web interface that allows developers to easily catch and inspect emails sent from their application during development. In this guide, you will install and use the [official MailHog extension for LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-extensions/tree/main/mailhog) and send an email through SES, while inspecting it in MailHog.

## Prerequisites

- [LocalStack Account](https://app.localstack.cloud/)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)

## Installation

To get started, start your LocalStack instance with your `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY`. Access our [Extension Manager](https://app.localstack.cloud/inst/default/extensions/manage), and click the **Install** button for the MailHog extension.

You'll receive a confirmation prompt indicating that LocalStack container will restart, after which the extension will become accessible. Check your LocalStack logs for MailHog extension output, where you should see relevant logging information:

```bash
2023-10-11T19:10:54.708  INFO --- [  MainThread] l.extensions.platform      : loaded 1 extensions

```

## Usage

MailHog enables you to conduct end-to-end testing of applications that utilize SES (Simple Email Service) for sending emails. To test this, let's use the AWS CLI to send an email.

### Send an Email

You can use the [`VerifyEmailIdentity`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ses/verify-email-identity.html) API to verify an email address with SES. This is a required step before you can send emails from SES. Run the following command to verify an email address:

{{< command >}}
$ aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 \
    ses verify-email-identity --email-address user1@yourdomain.com
{{< /command >}}

You can further send an email using the [`SendEmail`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ses/send-email.html) API. Run the following command to send an email:

{{< command >}}
$ aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 \
    ses send-email \
    --from user1@yourdomain.com \
    --message 'Body={Text={Data="Hello from LocalStack to MailHog"}},Subject={Data=Test Email}' \
    --destination 'ToAddresses=recipient1@example.com'
{{< /command >}}

### Navigate to Extension UI

Navigate in your browser to the [MailHog UI in LocalStack](http://mailhog.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/). You should see the email you sent in the MailHog UI.
