## Introduction

LocalStack extensions allows you to extend and customize LocalStack.
A LocalStack extension is a Python application that runs together with LocalStack within the LocalStack container.

LocalStack extensions are available to licensed users, and the list of available extensions can be found in the [Extensions Library](https://app.localstack.cloud/extensions/library).
