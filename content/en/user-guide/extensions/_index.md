LocalStack Extensions allow developers to extend and customize LocalStack.
Extensions are a feature of our paid offering.
To install and use extensions, you need an active LocalStack license.

Specific LocalStack Extensions are documented [here]({{< ref "user-guide/extensions/official-extensions" >}}) and
can be discovered on our [Extension Library](https://app.localstack.cloud/extensions/library).
Our blogpost about [LocalStackâ€™s Cloudflare Extension](https://localstack.cloud/blog/2023-06-26-develop-your-cloudflare-workers-aws-apps-locally-with-localstack-miniflare/)
showcases LocalStack as a local cloud development platform beyond AWS emulation.

{{<alert title="Note">}}
The feature and the API are currently experimental and may be subject to change.
