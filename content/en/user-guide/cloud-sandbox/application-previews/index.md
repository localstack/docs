description: Create an Application Preview to deploy your application changes in an Ephemeral Instance
---

## Introduction

Application Preview generates a preview environment from GitHub Pull Requests (PRs). 
It allows temporary deployment of AWS or Snowflake powered applications on a LocalStack Ephemeral Instance to preview changes. 
This feature is currently only available for GitHub repositories that use GitHub Actions.

Ephemeral Instances is offered as a **preview** feature and under active development.

## Getting started

This guide is designed for users new to Application Preview and assumes basic knowledge of GitHub Actions. 
We will configure a CI pipeline that runs on pull requests using GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites

- [LocalStack Account](https://app.localstack.cloud/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

### Create the Application Preview

To create an Application Preview, use the [`LocalStack/setup-localstack` action](https://github.com/localstack/setup-localstack).

Create a file named `preview-pipeline.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your custom repository. 
This file should contain the CI pipeline that activates on every pull request. 

The pipeline deploys the application to a LocalStack Ephemeral Instance using a `deploy.sh` script or similar for full application deployment. 
A comment containg the preview link is automatically added to a Pull Request when created.

```yaml 
uses: LocalStack/setup-localstack@v0.2.2
with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    state-backend: ephemeral
    state-action: start
    # Adding this option prevents Ephemeral Instance to be stopped after the `preview-cmd` run
    skip-ephemeral-stop: 'true'
    # Optional script/command to run
    preview-cmd: deploy.sh
env:
    LOCALSTACK_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCALSTACK_API_KEY }}
```

You must also set the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` as a repository secret, available from the [LocalStack Web Application](https://app.localstack.cloud/account/apikeys). 
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically generated by GitHub and requires no further configuration.

### Stop the Application Preview 

To stop the Application Preview, you can configure the `state-action` to `stop`.

```yaml 
uses: LocalStack/setup-localstack@v0.2.2
with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    state-backend: ephemeral
    state-action: stop
env:
    LOCALSTACK_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCALSTACK_API_KEY }}
```

|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `auto-load-pod`              | Specifies which Cloud Pod to load during LocalStack startup                     | `None`       |
| `extension-auto-install`     | Defines which extensions to install during LocalStack startup for Application Previews | `None`       |
| `lifetime`                   | Duration an Application Preview remains active                            | 30           |
| `state-backend`              | Starts an Application Preview, used with `state-action` to manage state  | `ephemeral`  |
| `state-action`               | Commands `start`/`stop` for managing Application Previews                |              |
| `skip-ephemeral-stop`        | Option to bypass stopping the Application Preview                        | `false`      |
| `preview-cmd`                | Commands to generate an Application Preview of the PR (supports `$AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`) |            |
