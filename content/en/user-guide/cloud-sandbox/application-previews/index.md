## Introduction

Application Preview generates a preview environment from GitHub Actions workflows.
For example, you can create a preview URL for every GitHub Pull Request (PRs).
It allows temporary deployment of AWS powered applications on a LocalStack Ephemeral Instance to preview changes.
This feature is currently only available for GitHub repositories that use GitHub Actions.

Application Preview is offered as a **preview** feature and is under active development.

## Getting started

This guide is designed for users new to Application Preview and assumes basic knowledge of GitHub Actions.
We will configure a CI pipeline that runs on pull requests using GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites

- [LocalStack Account](https://app.localstack.cloud/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

### Create the Application Preview

To create an Application Preview, use the [`LocalStack/setup-localstack` action](https://github.com/localstack/setup-localstack).

Create a file named `preview-pipeline.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your custom repository.
The example below contains the details that can be used for a step in an existing CI pipeline that activates on every pull request.

The pipeline deploys the application to a LocalStack Ephemeral Instance.
The steps necessary for building and deploying the application to  LocalStack should be listed within the `preview-cmd` property.
The example below aggregates these steps into a single deployment script called `deploy.sh`.
A comment containing the preview link is automatically added to a Pull Request when created.
This preview is available for 30 minutes

```yaml
uses: LocalStack/setup-localstack@v0.2.3
with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    state-backend: ephemeral
    state-action: start
    # Adding this option prevents Ephemeral Instance to be stopped after the `preview-cmd` run
    skip-ephemeral-stop: 'true'
    # Optional script/command to run
    preview-cmd: deploy.sh
env:
    LOCALSTACK_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCALSTACK_API_KEY }}
```

The `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` must be set as a repository secret.
You can create a [CI key](https://app.localstack.cloud/workspace/ci-keys) via the LocalStack Web Application (note that you may need permission from your administrator to access this capability).
To add this secret to a GitHub repository, go to the "Settings" tab and then on the left-hand navigation choose "Secrets and variables" and then "Actions".
The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically generated by GitHub and requires no further configuration.

### Stop the Application Preview

It's important to understand that the ephemeral instance that powers the application preview is created _before_ the steps in the `preview-cmd` are run.
If the `preview-cmd` fails to complete successfully, the ephemeral instance will still be running on your account.
To address this, you can create an additional workflow step that shuts down the ephemeral instance if the workflow run fails (see the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#running-a-workflow-based-on-the-conclusion-of-another-workflow) for help in determining whether a workflow completed successfully).

To stop the Application Preview, you can configure the `state-action` to `stop`.

```yaml
uses: LocalStack/setup-localstack@v0.2.2
with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    state-backend: ephemeral
    state-action: stop
env:
    LOCALSTACK_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LOCALSTACK_API_KEY }}
```

## Configuration

| Input                        | Description                                                               | Default      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `auto-load-pod`              | Specifies which Cloud Pod to load during LocalStack startup                     | `None`       |
| `extension-auto-install`     | Defines which extensions to install during LocalStack startup for Application Previews | `None`       |
| `lifetime`                   | Duration an Application Preview remains active                            | 30           |
| `state-backend`              | Starts an Application Preview, used with `state-action` to manage state  | `ephemeral`  |
| `state-action`               | Commands `start`/`stop` for managing Application Previews                |              |
| `skip-ephemeral-stop`        | Option to bypass stopping the Application Preview                        | `false`      |
| `preview-cmd`                | Commands to generate the application Preview of the PR (supports `$AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`) |            |

## Overriding the Application Preview URL

The Application Preview URL is automatically generated and added as a comment to the Pull Request.
However, if your application is served on a different URL, you can override the URL using the `LS_PREVIEW_URL`.
It is beneficial if you are using a CloudFront distribution or a custom domain.

Here is an example of how to override the URL:

```yaml
preview-cmd: |
    make build;
    make bootstrap;
    make deploy;
    make build-frontend;
    make deploy-frontend;
    distributionId=$(awslocal cloudfront list-distributions | jq -r '.DistributionList.Items[0].Id');
    echo LS_PREVIEW_URL=$AWS_ENDPOINT_URL/cloudfront/$distributionId/ >> $GITHUB_ENV;
```
