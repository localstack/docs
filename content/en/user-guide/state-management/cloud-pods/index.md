## Introduction

Cloud pods are persistent state snapshots of your LocalStack instance that can easily be stored, versioned, shared, and restored. Cloud Pods can be used for various purposes, such as:

-  Save and manage snapshots of active LocalStack instances.
-  Share state snapshots with your team to debug collectively.
-  Automate your testing pipelines by pre-seeding CI environments.
-  Create reproducible development and testing environments locally.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
Cloud Pods is only available to LocalStack Team users. LocalStack Pro users can access other state management features, such as [Persistence]({{< ref "persistence" >}}) and [State Export & Import]({{< ref "export-import-state" >}}).
{{< /alert >}}

## Installation

You can save and load the persistent state of Cloud Pods, you can use the [Cloud Pods command-line interface (CLI)]({{< ref "pods-cli" >}}). LocalStack provides a remote storage backend that can be used to store the state of your running application and share it with your team members. You can interact with the Cloud Pods over the storage backend via the LocalStack Web Application.

Cloud Pods CLI is included in the [LocalStack CLI installation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli), so there's no need for additional installations to begin using it. If you're a licensed user, we suggest setting the `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` as an environment variable. This enables you to access the complete range of LocalStack Cloud Pods features.

You can access the Cloud Pods CLI by running the `pod` command from your terminal.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod --help
Usage: localstack pod [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
<disable-copy>
  Manage the state of your instance via Cloud Pods.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  delete    Delete a Cloud Pod
  inspect
  list      List all available Cloud Pods
  load
  remote    Manage cloud pod remotes
  save      Create a new Cloud Pod
  versions
</disable-copy>
{{< / command >}}

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
These Cloud Pods are securely stored within an AWS storage backend, where each user or organization is allocated a dedicated and isolated S3 bucket. The LocalStack Cloud Pods CLI utilizes secure S3 presigned URLs to directly interface with the S3 bucket, bypassing the need to transmit the state files through LocalStack Platform APIs.
{{< /alert >}}

## Getting started

This guide is designed for users new to Cloud Pods and assumes basic knowledge of the LocalStack CLI and our [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local) wrapper script.

Start your LocalStack container using your preferred method. We will demonstrate how you can save a snapshot of your active LocalStack instance into your LocalStack account, and pull it to a running instance.

### Create AWS resources

You can use the `awslocal` CLI to create new AWS resources within your active LocalStack instance. For example, you can create an S3 bucket and add data to it using the `awslocal` CLI:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal s3 mb s3://test
$ echo "hello world" > /tmp/hello-world
$ awslocal s3 cp /tmp/hello-world s3://test/hello-world
$ awslocal s3 ls s3://test/
{{< / command >}}

### Save your Cloud Pod state

You can now your Pod state using the `save` command, specifying the desired Cloud Pod name as the first argument. This action will save the pod and register it with the LocalStack Web Application:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod save s3-test
<disable-copy>
Cloud Pod `s3-test` successfully created ✅
Version: 1
Remote: platform
Services: s3
</disable-copy>
{{< / command >}}

Optionally, you can include a message with the saved Cloud Pod using the `--message` flag.

You can access the list of available Cloud Pods for both you and your organization by utilizing the `list` command:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod list
<disable-copy>
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name                         ┃ Max Version ┃ Last Change         ┃

└──────────────────────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────────────┘
</disable-copy>
{{< / command >}}

### Inspect the contents of a Cloud Pod

You can inspect the contents of a Cloud Pod using the `inspect` command:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod inspect s3-test --format json
<disable-copy>
{
    "000000000000": {
        "S3": {
            "global": {
                "listBuckets": {
                    "Buckets": [
                        {
                            "Name": "test",
                            "CreationDate": "2023-10-03T07:19:31.000Z"
                        }
                    ],
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</disable-copy>
{{< / command >}}

### Pull your Pod state

 On a separate machine, start LocalStack while ensuring the auth token is properly configured. Then, retrieve the previously created Cloud Pod by employing the `load` command, specifying the Cloud Pod name as the first argument:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod load s3-test
<disable-copy>
Cloud Pod s3-test successfully loaded
</disable-copy>
{{< / command >}}

You can examine the S3 buckets within the Cloud Pod:

{{< command >}}
$ awslocal s3 ls s3://test/
<disable-copy>
2022-10-04 22:33:54         12 hello-world
</disable-copy>
{{< / command >}}

For comprehensive instructions, navigate to our [Command-Line Interface (CLI) Guide]({{< ref "pods-cli" >}}). To access your Cloud Pods through the LocalStack Web Application, navigate to the [Cloud Pods browser](https://app.localstack.cloud/pods).

## Web Application

The LocalStack Web Application enables you to export your infrastructure state to a Cloud Pod and import it into another LocalStack instance.

<img src="export-import-state-cloud-pod.png" alt="LocalStack Export/Import State Cloud Pod Mode" title="LocalStack Export/Import State Cloud Pod Mode" width="900" />


### Export the State

To export the state, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Cloud Pod** tab within the [Export/Import State](https://app.localstack.cloud/inst/default/state) page.
2. Create AWS resources locally as needed.
3. Enter the Pod name and toggle between the **New Pod** and **Existing Pod** options.
4. Click on **Create New Pod**.

A new Cloud Pod will be created and will be available for import into another LocalStack instance. You can check out the list of available Cloud Pods in the [Cloud Pod](https://app.localstack.cloud/pods) page.

### Import the State

To import the state, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Cloud Pod** tab within the [Export/Import State](https://app.localstack.cloud/inst/default/state) page.
2. Choose the Cloud Pod from the drop-down list.
3. Click on **Load State From Pod**.

To confirm the successful injection of the container state, visit the respective [Resource Browser](https://app.localstack.cloud/inst/default/resources) for the services and verify the resources.

## Auto Loading Cloud Pods

In addition to loading Cloud Pods through the Command-Line Interface (CLI) or the Web Application, you can configure the automatic loading of one or more Cloud Pods upon the startup of the LocalStack container.

### Environmental variables

To automatically load a Cloud Pod at startup, utilize the `AUTO_LOAD_POD` [configuration variable](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/configuration/).

`AUTO_LOAD_POD` can accept multiple Cloud Pod names separated by commas. To autoload multiple Cloud Pods, such as `foo-pod` and `bar-pod`, use: `AUTO_LOAD_POD=foo-pod,bar-pod`. The order of Cloud Pods in `AUTO_LOAD_POD` dictates their loading sequence. When autoloading multiple Cloud Pods, later pods might overwrite the state of earlier ones if they share the same service, account, and region.

{{< tab header="LocalStack CLI" lang="bash" >}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Docker Compose" lang="yaml" >}}

    container_name: "localstack-main"
    image: localstack/localstack-pro
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?}
      - DEBUG=1
      - AUTO_LOAD_POD=foo-pod,bar-pod
    volumes:
      - "./volume:/var/lib/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Docker" lang="bash" >}}
docker run \
  -e LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?} \
  -e AUTO_LOAD_POD=foo-pod \
  -v ./volume:/var/lib/localstack \
  -p 4566:4566 \
  localstack/localstack-pro
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

### Configuration file

LocalStack allows for the use of configuration files to automatically load Cloud Pods during startup.

Within the container, LocalStack searches through the `/etc/localstack/init-pod.d` directory for two file types: `zip` files created using the `localstack state export` command, and `txt` files, where each line represents the name of a Cloud Pod.

Take the following example of a project layout:

```bash
.
├── docker-compose.yml
└── init-pods.d
    ├── pod-list.txt
    └── my-state.pod.zip
```

The `pod-list.txt` contains the following:

```text
foo-pod
bar-pod
```

LocalStack, upon mounting `init-pods.d` to the appropriate location, will sequentially load `foo-pod` and `bar-pod` as listed in `pod-list.txt`, and then proceed to load `my-state.pod.zip`.

The docker compose file for correctly mounting `init-pods.d` will look like:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "localstack-main"
    image: localstack/localstack-pro
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?}
      - DEBUG=1
    volumes:
      - "./volume:/var/lib/localstack"
      - "./init-pods.d:/etc/localstack/init-pods.d"
```

## Remotes

A remote is the location where Cloud Pods are stored. By default, Cloud Pod artifacts are stored in the LocalStack platform. However, if your organization's data regulations or sovereignty requirements prohibit storing Cloud Pod assets in a remote storage infrastructure, you have the option to persist Cloud Pods in an on-premises storage location under your complete control.

LocalStack provides two types of alternative remotes:

-   S3 bucket remote storage.
-   [ORAS](https://oras.land/) (OCI Registry as Storage) remote storage.

Cloud Pods command-line interface (CLI) allows you to create, delete, and list remotes.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod remote --help
<disable-copy>
Usage: localstack pod remote [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Manage cloud pod remotes

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add     Add a remote
  delete  Delete a remote
  list    List the available remotes
</disable-copy>
{{< / command >}}

### S3 bucket remote storage

The S3 remote enables you to store Cloud Pod assets in an existing S3 bucket within an actual AWS account. The initial step is to export the necessary AWS credentials within the terminal session.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
The Cloud Pods S3 remote is currently _only_ available when [installing the `localstack` CLI via `pip`](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli), and not for the binary CLI distribution.
{{< /alert >}}

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

A possible option is to obtain credentials via [AWS SSO CLI](https://github.com/synfinatic/aws-sso-cli).

Next, we establish a new remote specifically designed for an S3 bucket. By running the following command, we create a remote named `s3-storage-aws` responsible for storing Cloud Pod artifacts in an S3 bucket called `ls-pods-bucket-test`.

The `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` placeholders ensure the correct transmission of AWS credentials to the container.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod remote add s3-storage-aws 's3://ls-pods-bucket-test/?access_key_id={access_key_id}&secret_access_key={secret_access_key}'
{{< / command >}}

Lastly, you can utilize the standard `pod` CLI command to generate a new Cloud Pod that points to the previously established remote.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod save my-pod s3-storage-aws
{{< / command >}}

Once the command has been executed, you can confirm the presence of Cloud Pod artifacts in the S3 bucket by simply running:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://ls-pods-bucket-test
2023-09-27 13:50:10      83650 localstack-pod-my-pod-state-1.zip
2023-09-27 13:50:11      85103 localstack-pod-my-pod-version-1.zip
```

You can use the `pod load` command to load the same pod that was previously saved in this remote:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod load my-pod s3-storage-aws
{{< / command >}}

### ORAS remote storage

The ORAS remote enables users to store Cloud Pods in OCI-compatible registries like Docker Hub, Nexus, or ECS registries. ORAS stands for "OCI Registry as Service," and you can find additional information about this standard [on the official website](https://oras.land/).

For example, let's illustrate how you can utilize Docker Hub to store and retrieve Cloud Pods.

To begin, you must configure the new remote using the LocalStack CLI. You'll need to export two essential environment variables, `ORAS_USERNAME` and `ORAS_PASSWORD`, which are necessary for authenticating with Docker Hub.

```bash
export ORAS_USERNAME=docker_hub_id
export ORAS_PASSWORD=ILoveLocalStack1!
```

You can now use the CLI to create a new remote called `oras-remote`.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod remote add oras-remote 'oras://{oras_username}:{oras_password}@registry.hub.docker.com/<docker_hub_id>'
{{< / command >}}

Lastly, you can store a pod using the newly configured remote, where `my-pod` represents the Cloud Pod's name, and `oras-remote` is the remote's name.

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod save my-pod oras-remote
{{< / command >}}

Likewise, you can execute the reverse operation to load a Cloud Pod from `oras-remote` using the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod load my-pod oras-remote
{{< / command >}}

### Miscellaneous

Unless explicitly specified, all Cloud Pods commands default to targeting the LocalStack Platform as the storage remote. It's important to note that the CLI must be authenticated correctly with our Platform, and a Team/Enterprise subscription is mandatory.

Custom remote configurations are stored within the [LocalStack volume directory](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/filesystem/#localstack-volume-directory) and are managed by the LocalStack container. Consequently, when sharing Cloud Pods among your team using a custom remote, each team member must define the identical remote configuration. Once added, a remote persists even after LocalStack restarts.

## Cloud Pods & Persistence

[Persistence]({{< ref "persistence" >}}) ensures that the service state persists across container restarts. You can enable persistence via a LocalStack config flag `PERSISTENCE=1` to restore your local resources, in case you’re stopping and re-starting the LocalStack instance on the same machine.

In contrast, Cloud Pods provide more detailed control over your state. Rather than just restoring a state during LocalStack restarts, Cloud Pods enable you to capture snapshots of your local instance using the `save` command and inject these snapshots into a running instance using the `load` command, all without needing to perform a full restart.
