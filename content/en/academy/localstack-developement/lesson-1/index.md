  This is the first video of the second module in our LocalStack e-course series. If you're new to LocalStack, be sure to check out our first module - LocalStack 101. In this video, we'll be exploring the different topics to be covered in this module such as 'developing and deploying' with LocalStack. We will deploy a full fledged container application that mimics a real world application complexity. In the course of this you get to know about Localstack integrations, CI workflow, deployment through terraform and cloudformation etc. Later we will talk about IAM policy stream, which helps us in correctly creating the IAM policy required for the application to work with the cloud resources. Towards the end we will see LocalStack Cloudpod feature which makes collaborative work such a breeze.
