  In this video we will discuss about Cloud pods, extending the discussion from module - 1. By default, LocalStack is an ephemeral environment, meaning that, once you terminate your LocalStack instance, all state will be discarded. Cloud Pods are a mechanism that allows you to take a snapshot of the current state of your LocalStack instance and easily share it with your team members. Furthermore we will pick a `QuickStart` guide to cloudpod and follow the on-screen tutorial to load a cloudpod in our environment using the web app. This cloudpod would 'load' the infrastructure and the deployed application onto our running localstack instance. The cloudpod contains the same application we deployed in this module.
