  In the previous video, we saw how we can use terraform to deploy resources on localstack. In this one, we will see how cloudformation, which is an AWS offering can be used to deploy resources on localstack. AWS CloudFormation is AWSâ€™s primary Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) service. It is used to declaratively define your architecture on the AWS cloud, including resources such as S3 Buckets, Lambda Functions, and much more. For deploying using AWS cloudformation we will be using awslocal - which is a thin wrapper around the aws command line interface for use with LocalStack.
