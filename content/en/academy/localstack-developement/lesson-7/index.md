  GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, with CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. The objective of this video is to use localstack along with all the infra built, for testing the code. Thus ensuring that the code to be merged in the main repo would work on the actual AWS infra that is deployed.
