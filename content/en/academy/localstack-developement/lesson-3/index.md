  In the last video where we manually deployed some AWS resources, we realized that there were a lot of resources that needed to be deployed and doing it manually can be really hard and prone to errors. We mostly interacted with LocalStack through the CLI. However, large systems are hardly built this way. To the rescue comes LocalStackâ€™s integrations. LocalStack supports a wide range of integrations from the cloud development ecosystem. One such integration is terraform, which is an Infrastructure as Code ( IaC ) tool, which we are going to use to setup the whole AWS infrastructure, that we discussed in the previous video. 
  
  We will also see how using Localstack's CircleCI integration, you can easily integrate it to your CI pipelines, to emulate AWS cloud in your pipelines.
