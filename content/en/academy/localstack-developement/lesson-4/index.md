  In this video we will be using LocalStack's terraform integration to automate the process of deploying and configuring the resources on localstack. For this we will be using `tflocal` - a small wrapper script to run Terraform against LocalStack. If you donâ€™t want to use tflocal, you can use terraform, with small changes to the tf file, which we will talk about later in the video.
