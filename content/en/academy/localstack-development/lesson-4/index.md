  In this video, we'll utilize LocalStack's Terraform integration to deploy and configure local AWS resources on LocalStack. We'll use tflocal, a wrapper CLI that enables you to run Terraform commands against LocalStack. Alternatively you can use terraform CLI directly with minor modifications to the Terraform configuration, a topic we'll cover later in the video.

In this video, we'll utilize Terraform to deploy AWS resources locally through LocalStack.
These resources include DynamoDB tables, API Gateway, and VPC.
We'll use `tflocal`, a wrapper CLI that serves as a wrapper on the `terraform` CLI to execute Terraform commands against LocalStack.

Here's a breakdown of the steps we'll take:

- We'll create a `main.tf` file and then apply the Terraform configuration on LocalStack.
- We'll demonstrate various configuration options for setting up the infrastructure for our application.
- After applying Terraform, we'll inspect the output, showcasing deployed resources such as API URLs, ECS cluster name, and VPC ID.
- Towards the end, we'll verify the deployment and resource creation using the Resource Browser.
