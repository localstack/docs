The LocalStack API key is a unique identifier to authenticate your LocalStack instance. You can find your API key in the [LocalStack Web app](https://app.localstack.cloud/account/apikeys). This guide demonstrates how you can use your new LocalStack licenses and go over some best practices regarding the usage, activation, and safety of your LocalStack API key.

## Getting your API key

To get started, you need to have a LocalStack license. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a free trial](https://localstack.cloud/pricing/) without any credit card required. The free trial will last 14 days, and you can use it to test all the features of LocalStack. After a free trial, you can find your API key in the [LocalStack Web app](https://app.localstack.cloud) in the **Account** â†’ **Subscriptions** section.

{{< alert title="API Key Security" >}}
- Avoid sharing your API key with anyone. Ensure that you do not commit it to any source code management systems (like Git repositories).

- If you push an API key to a public repository, it has potentially been exposed and might remain in the history (even if you try to rewrite it).

- If you accidentally publish your API key, please [contact us](https://localstack.cloud/contact/) immediately to get your API key rotated!

- If you want to use your API key in your CI environment, check out our [CI documentation]({{< ref "user-guide/ci" >}}) to see the proper way to handle secrets in your CI environment to store your API key securely.

## Using your API key

LocalStack expects your API key to be present in the environment variable `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY`. Before starting LocalStack, define the environment variable - for example, using the following command in a MacOS or Linux environment:

{{< command >}}
$ export LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
{{< / command >}}

{{< alert >}}
If you are using LocalStack with an API Key, you need to pull `localstack/localstack-pro` image as part of your LocalStack setup. Going forward, `localstack/localstack-pro` image will contain our Pro-supported services and APIs.

### Starting LocalStack via CLI

To start LocalStack using the LocalStack CLI, you don't have to perform any further steps (after exporting the environment variable).

{{< command >}}
$ localstack start
{{< / command >}}

LocalStack will detect the API key and properly pass it to the LocalStack container.

### Starting LocalStack via Docker

To start LocalStack using Docker, you have to specify the API key using the `-e` flag for environment variables:

{{< command "hl_lines=5" >}}
$ docker run \
  --rm -it \
  -p 4566:4566 \
  -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 \
  -e LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=${LOCALSTACK_API_KEY:- } \
  localstack/localstack-pro
{{< / command >}}

For more information about starting LocalStack, take a look at our general [Getting Started]({{< ref "getting-started" >}}) guide.

### Starting LocalStack via Docker-Compose

To start LocalStack using `docker-compose`, you have to include the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
environment:
  - LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=${LOCALSTACK_API_KEY- }
```

It sets the API key we defined before (by using the `export` command) into your LocalStack container, such that the key activation can take place.

## Licensing-related configuration

If you want to make sure that LocalStack is only started if you can activate LocalStack Pro or Enterprise, or if you wish to suppress licensing-related error messages, take a look at our [configuration guide]({{< ref "configuration.md#localstack-pro">}}) regarding LocalStack Pro.

## Checking license activation

The easiest way to check if LocalStack is activated is to query the health endpoint for a list of the running services:

{{< command >}}
$ curl localhost:4566/_localstack/health | jq
{{< / command >}}

If a Pro-only [service]({{< ref "aws" >}}) -- like [XRay]({{< ref "XRay-Tracing" >}}) -- is running, LocalStack has started successfully. You can also check the logs of the LocalStack container to see if the activation was successful.

{{< command >}}
[...] Successfully activated API key
{{< / command >}}
