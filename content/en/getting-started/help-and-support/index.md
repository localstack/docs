## Support Resources

Our support team comprises highly qualified experts who possess extensive expertise in AWS and other pertinent tools.
We utilize a range of resources, including documentation, knowledge bases, and industry best practices, to provide you with accurate and reliable guidance.
However, please note that our support resources are subject to availability, therefore our best effort support is provided asynchronously.
Inquiries may be prioritized based on urgency and impact.

## Support plans

### Basic support

Basic Support is available to all LocalStack users and includes access to documentation, community support, and account management (operational support).

Community support is available through the following channels:

- [LocalStack Slack Community](https://localstack.cloud/slack)
- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/localstack/docs/issues/new)

Note that community support is provided on a best-effort basis and is not guaranteed.
Users are encouraged to help others by sharing their knowledge and experiences.

#### LocalStack Slack Community

LocalStack Slack Community includes LocalStack users, contributors, and maintainers.
If you need help with the community version of LocalStack, please use the `#help` channel.
You can sign up for the [LocalStack Slack Community](https://localstack.cloud/slack) by creating an account.

However, the messages on Slack are not accessible after three months, so it is not the best place to ask questions that may be useful to others in the future.
For that, we recommend using LocalStack Discuss.

#### GitHub Issue

You can use GitHub Issue to:

- [Request new features](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature%2Cstatus%3A+triage+needed&template=feature-request.yml&title=feature+request%3A+%3Ctitle%3E)
- [Report existing bugs](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug%2Cstatus%3A+triage+needed&template=bug-report.yml&title=bug%3A+%3Ctitle%3E)

Make sure to follow the issue templates and provide as much information as possible.
If you have encountered outdated documentation, please report it on our [documentation repository](https://github.com/localstack/docs).

### Standard support

Standard support is available to users with an active Starter or Trial subscription.
This includes 1v1 support on a best-effort basis, without guaranteed response times.
However, the support team aims to respond to inquiries within 24–48 hours during [regular business hours](#support-business-hours).

#### Scope

Our objective is to respond to your inquiries and provide guidance on using LocalStack environment with all its features to the best of our abilities.
It is important to note that our best effort support may have certain limitations.

LocalStack's usage is subject to various factors such as the complexity of your IT environment, specific integrations, and dependencies.
While we strive to provide comprehensive support for LocalStack, there are certain areas that fall outside our scope:

- **Third-Party Tools**: We do not offer support for third-party tools or software that integrate with or work alongside LocalStack.
  This includes, but is not limited to external monitoring tools, third-party plugins, development environments and build tools.
- **Customer-Specific Code**: Our support does not extend to the custom code that customers build using LocalStack.
  This includes debugging, optimizing, or modifying customer-written scripts, applications, or workflows.
- **AWS Services in Production**: We do not provide support for the deployment, management, or troubleshooting of AWS services in a production environment.
  Our focus is solely on the emulated services within LocalStack.

#### Channels

Standard support can be accessed through the following channels:

- [LocalStack Slack Bot](https://localstack.cloud/slack)
- [LocalStack Web Application](https://app.localstack.cloud)

Providing detailed information upfront helps our team respond more quickly and efficiently.
After submitting, the support team will respond as soon as possible.

##### LocalStack Support Bot

To create a support ticket:

- Search for the LocalStack Pro Support in our [Slack Community](https://localstack.cloud/slack).
- Navigate to Messages and type your request.
- Include relevant details such as error logs, configuration settings, and steps to reproduce the issue.

##### LocalStack Web Application

To create a support ticket:

- Navigate to the [LocalStack Web Application](http://app.localstack.cloud).
- Click on the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the page.
- Select **Technical Question** from the menu.
- Fill in the required details and send your message.

### Priority support

Priority support is available for users with active Teams subscription, offering dedicated 1v1 assistance and faster response times:

- **First response**: within 24 hours
- **Follow-up responses:** within 24 hours

Please note that all responses are provided during our normal operating hours.
While we strive to respond within a 24-hour timeframe, we cannot guarantee that every response will meet this timeline.

#### Scope

As part of our Priority support plan, we offer limited support for third-party tools that integrate with LocalStack.
This support is provided on a best-effort basis and covers tools that are officially supported and mentioned in our documentation.

Our aim is to enhance your development experience by assisting with the integration and basic troubleshooting of these tools.
While we strive to provide comprehensive assistance, there are certain limitations to our third-party tools support:

- **Best Effort Basis:** Support for third-party tools is provided on a best-effort basis, meaning that while we will do our utmost to assist, we cannot guarantee resolution for all issues.
- **Officially Supported Tools Only:** Our support is limited to officially integrated third-party tools with LocalStack.
  For other tools, we recommend consulting the tool's official support channels or resources.
- **Basic Troubleshooting:** Our support focuses on basic troubleshooting and integration guidance.
  We do not provide in-depth support for advanced configurations, customizations, or optimization of third-party tools.

#### Screen sharing sessions

To enhance issue identification and provide a more efficient troubleshooting experience, our support engineers may offer scheduled live screen sharing sessions.
During these sessions, our support engineers can directly observe and diagnose the issues you are encountering, ensuring a quicker and more effective resolution.

### Enterprise support

To learn more about the support available to **Enterprise** plan users, refer to the [Enterprise Support]({{<ref "enterprise-support" >}}) page.

To use LocalStack's diagnostics endpoint:

- Set the environment variable `LS_LOG=trace`
