## LocalStack Core FAQs

### How to update my LocalStack CLI?

If the LocalStack CLI version is heavily outdated, it might lead to issues with container startup and debug commands. If you are using an older version of LocalStack, you can update it by running the following command:

{{< command >}}
pip install --upgrade localstack localstack-ext
{{< / command >}}

If you are running a newer version of LocalStack, you can check the version by running the following command:

{{< command >}}
localstack update localstack-cli
{{< / command >}}

### Is using `localhost.localstack.cloud:4566` to set as the endpoint for AWS services recommended?

`localhost.localstack.cloud` is the recommended endpoint - especially for S3, in order to enable host-based bucket endpoints. For most of the other services, it is fine to use `localhost:4566`. Users can rely on the `localhost.localstack.cloud` domain to be publicly resolvable, and we also publish an SSL certificate that is automatically used inside LocalStack, in order to enable HTTPS endpoints with valid certificates.

Across our docs, we use `localhost:4566` instead of `localhost.localstack.cloud`, to provide a fallback option to users. The primary reason being that some users are behind a corporate firewall or an internet service provider that does not allow resolving `localhost.localstack.cloud` properly.

### How should I use the latest LocalStack Docker images?

To use the latest LocalStack Docker images, you either run `docker pull localstack/localstack:latest` or use the `docker-compose pull` if the image is set to `localstack/localstack:latest`. You can also specify a particular digest to make sure you are using the correct image, like this: `localstack/localstack:latest@sha256:f803cc657843c6c7acf2631d15600783c3593e496fba418415afc87680d9d5bc`.

You can also use the our diagnose endpoint (`http://localhost:4566/_localstack/diagnose`) to get the specific image hashes and compare them with the current (latest) images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/).
The diagnose endpoint is only available if you run LocalStack with `DEBUG=1`.

### How can I access LocalStack from an alternative computer?

You can access LocalStack from an alternative computer, by exposing port `4566` to the public network interface (`0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`) in your `docker-compose.yml` configuration. However, we do not recommend using this setup - for security reasons, as it exposes your local computer to potential attacks from the outside world.

### How do I resolve connection issues with proxy blocking access to LocalStack's BigData image?

A company proxy can lead to connection issues. To allow access to the `localstack/bigdata` image, use the following Docker configuration in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
...
environment: 
- HTTP_PROXY = 
- NO_PROXY = .s3.localhost.localstack.cloud,127.0.0.1,*.localhost
...
```

### How to troubleshoot the DNS issue for LocalStack's BigData image?

Occasionally, users have wrong configuration of their `docker-compose.yml` or `ENV` variables. ´Some Glue scripts depend on the local DNS setup. To resolve DNS issues, set TCP port `53` in LocalStack's `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
ports:
       - "53:53"
       …
```

Furthermore, use either the default name `localstack_main` for the container, or alternatively configure the environment variable `MAIN_CONTAINER_NAME` to point to the correct name.

```yaml
container_name: localstack_main
```

Ensure that `127.0.0.1` is configured as the target DNS server for the `bigdata` container:

```yaml
docker inspect localstack_bigdata --format '{{ .HostConfig.Dns }}'

Output: [127.0.0.1]
```

You can test it by attempting to resolve an S3 hostname, which should then internally get routed to the LocalStack API endpoints.

```bash
docker exec -it localstack_bigdata curl -vk https://test.s3.amazonaws.com
```

### Why can't my other Docker containers reach LocalStack?

Using LocalStack inside a Docker network with multiple other containers can lead to connectivity issues from/to those containers. For example, a container which attempts to deploy a stack and interact with the services directly, from within the same Docker network.

To resolve this, set `HOSTNAME_EXTERNAL` for correct response values for endpoints. Use network aliases to ensure resolution of `localhost.localstack.cloud` to the correct container:

```yaml
...
    networks:
      default:
        aliases:
          - localhost.localstack.cloud
  sdkstack:
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["bash", "-c", "apt update && apt install -y curl && sleep 5 && curl -v http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/health"]
...
```

Note the missing `network: bridge` here! The default bridge network does not support DNS name resolution.

### How to resolve the pull rate limit issue for LocalStack's Docker image?

If you receive `ERROR: toomanyrequests: Too Many Requests.` when pulling the LocalStack Docker image, you have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by [authenticating and upgrading](https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits). Set your DockerHub credentials:

```bash
(sudo) docker login --username=yourUsername
```

You can add in the volume `~/.docker/config.json:/config.json` where the `config.json` is saved and point the `DOCKER_CONFIG=/config.json` variable to the JSON file in the Docker image.

```yaml
...
    environment:
      - DOCKER_CONFIG=/config.json
    volumes:
      - ~/.docker/config.json:/config.json
...
```

## LocalStack Platform FAQs

### How do I check if my API key is valid and activated?

The easiest way to check if LocalStack Pro or Enterprise is activated is to check the health endpoint of LocalStack for a list of the running services:

{{< command >}}
$ curl localhost:4566/_localstack/health | jq
{{< / command >}}

If a Pro-only [service]({{< ref "aws" >}}) -- like [XRay]({{< ref "XRay-Tracing" >}}) -- is running, LocalStack Pro or Enterprise has started successfully. If your API key is invalid, you will see an error message like this in the logs of LocalStack:

```bash
Activation key "abc..."(10) is invalid or expired! Reason: ...
```

If this error occurs, something is wrong with your API key or license. Make sure your API key is set correctly (check for typos!) and your license is valid. If the API key still does not work, please [contact us](https://localstack.cloud/contact/).

### How are CI credits in LocalStack calculated?

A CI key allows you to use LocalStack in your CI environment. Every activation of a CI key consumes one build credit. This means that with every build triggered through the LocalStack container you will consume one credit. To understand the CI pricing across our product tiers, follow up with our [LocalStack in CI]({{<ref "user-guide/ci">}}) documentation.

### What should I do if I cannot connect to LocalStack API?

If your log output contains lines like:

```shell
WARNING:localstack_ext.bootstrap.licensing: Error activating API key "abc..."(10):
...
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

LocalStack cannot contact our API to perform the license activation. Confirm with your network administrator that no policies block the connection to our backend.

### What should I do if I cannot resolve `api.localstack.cloud`?

Log output like the following indicates that your machine cannot resolve the domain of the LocalStack API.

```shell
WARNING:localstack_ext.bootstrap.licensing: Error activating API key "abc..."(10):
...
socket.gaierror: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution
```

Confirm this by using a tool like `dig`:

{{< command >}}
$ dig api.localstack.cloud
{{< / command >}}

If the result has some other status than `status: NOERROR,` your machine cannot resolve this domain.

Some corporate DNS servers might filter requests to certain domains. Contact your network administrator to safelist` localstack.cloud` domains.
