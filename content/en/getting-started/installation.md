## LocalStack CLI

The quickest way get started with LocalStack is by using the LocalStack CLI.
It allows you to start LocalStack from your command line.
Please make sure that you have a working [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine before moving on.

The CLI starts and manages the LocalStack Docker container.
For alternative methods of managing the LocalStack container, see our [alternative installation instructions]({{< ref "#alternatives" >}}).

</p>

<p>
Please make sure to install the following before moving ahead:
{{% markdown %}}
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) (versions 3.7 to 3.11)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
{{% /markdown %}}
</p>

<p>
Next install the LocalStack CLI in your Python environment by running:
{{< command >}}
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade localstack
{{< / command >}}
</p>

{{< callout "note" >}}
To download a specific version of LocalStack, replace `<version>` with the required version from [release page](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/releases).

{{< command >}}
$ python3 -m pip install localstack==<version>
{{< /command >}}
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout "tip" >}}
If you have problems with permissions in MacOS X Sierra, install with:
{{< command >}}
$ python3 -m pip install --user localstack
{{< /command >}}

{{< /callout >}}
{{< callout "warning" >}}
Do not use `sudo` or the `root` user when starting LocalStack.
It should be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

To verify that the LocalStack CLI was installed correctly, you can check the version in your terminal:
{{< command >}}
$ localstack --version
{{< localstack-latest-version >}}
{{< / command >}}

You are all set!

To use all of LocalStack's features we recommend to [get a LocalStack account and set up your auth token]({{< ref "auth-token" >}}).
Afterwards, check out our [Quickstart guide]({{< ref "quickstart" >}}) to start your local cloud!

## Alternatives

Besides using the CLI, there are other ways of starting and managing your LocalStack instance:

- [LocalStack Desktop]({{< ref "#localstack-desktop" >}})\
  Get a desktop experience and work with your local LocalStack instance via the UI.

- [LocalStack Docker Extension]({{< ref "#localstack-docker-extension" >}})\
  Use the LocalStack extension for Docker Desktop to work with your LocalStack instance.

- [Docker-Compose]({{< ref "#docker-compose" >}})\
  Use Docker Compose to configure and start your LocalStack Docker container.

- [Docker]({{< ref "#docker" >}})\
  Use the Docker CLI to manually start the LocalStack Docker container.

- [Helm]({{< ref "#helm" >}})\
  Use Helm to create a LocalStack deployment in a Kubernetes cluster.

LocalStack runs inside a Docker container, and the above options are different ways to start and manage the LocalStack Docker container.
For a comprehensive overview of the LocalStack images, check out our [Docker images documentation]({{< ref "docker-images" >}}).

### LocalStack Desktop

Learn more about our desktop client at [LocalStack Desktop]({{< ref "localstack-desktop" >}}) and download it [here](https://app.localstack.cloud/download).

### LocalStack Docker Extension

Install our [official Docker Desktop extension](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/localstack/localstack-docker-desktop) to manage LocalStack.
See [LocalStack Docker Extension]({{< ref "localstack-docker-extension" >}}) for more information.

### Docker-Compose

To use LocalStack without the [LocalStack CLI]({{< ref "#localstack-cli" >}}), you have the option of running the LocalStack Docker container by yourself.
If you want to manually manage your Docker container, it's usually a good idea to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) in order to simplify your container configuration.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.9.0+)

#### Starting LocalStack with Docker-Compose

You can start LocalStack with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) by configuring a `docker-compose.yml` file.
Docker Compose v1.9.0 and above is supported.

{{< tabpane lang="yml" >}}
{{< tab header="Community" lang="yml" >}}
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "${LOCALSTACK_DOCKER_NAME:-localstack-main}"
    image: localstack/localstack
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"            # LocalStack Gateway

      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Pro" lang="yml" >}}
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "${LOCALSTACK_DOCKER_NAME:-localstack-main}"
    image: localstack/localstack-pro  # required for Pro
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"            # LocalStack Gateway
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"  # external services port range
      - "127.0.0.1:443:443"              # LocalStack HTTPS Gateway (Pro)
    environment:
      # Activate LocalStack Pro: https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/auth-token/
      - LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?}  # required for Pro
      # LocalStack configuration: https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/configuration/
      - DEBUG=${DEBUG:-0}
      - PERSISTENCE=${PERSISTENCE:-0}
    volumes:
      - "${LOCALSTACK_VOLUME_DIR:-./volume}:/var/lib/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

Start the container by running the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker-compose up
{{< / command >}}

{{< callout "note" >}}
- This command pulls the current nightly build from the `master` branch (if you don't have the image locally) and **not** the latest supported version.
  If you want to use a specific version, set the appropriate LocalStack image tag at `services.localstack.image` in the `docker-compose.yml` file (for example `localstack/localstack:<version>`).

- If you are using LocalStack with an [auth token]({{< ref "auth-token" >}}), you need to specify the image tag as `localstack/localstack-pro` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  Going forward, `localstack/localstack-pro` image will contain our Pro-supported services and APIs.

- This command reuses the image if it's already on your machine, i.e. it will **not** pull the latest image automatically from Docker Hub.

- Mounting the Docker socket `/var/run/docker.sock` as a volume is required for some services that use Docker to provide the emulation, such as AWS Lambda.
  Check out the [Lambda providers]({{< ref "user-guide/aws/lambda" >}}) documentation for more information.

- To facilitate interoperability, configuration variables can be prefixed with `LOCALSTACK_` in docker.
  For instance, setting `LOCALSTACK_PERSISTENCE=1` is equivalent to `PERSISTENCE=1`.

- If using the Docker default bridge network using `network_mode: bridge`, container name resolution will not work inside your containers.
  Please consider removing it, if this functionality is needed.

- To configure an auth token, refer to the [auth token]({{< ref "auth-token" >}}) documentation.
{{< /callout >}}

Please note that there are a few pitfalls when configuring your stack manually via docker-compose (e.g., required container name, Docker network, volume mounts, and environment variables).
We recommend using the LocalStack CLI to validate your configuration, which will print warning messages in case it detects any potential misconfigurations:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack config validate
...
{{< / command >}}

### Docker

You can also directly start the LocalStack container using the Docker CLI instead of [Docker-Compose]({{< ref "#docker-compose" >}}).
This method requires more manual steps and configuration, but it gives you more control over the container settings.

#### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have a working [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine before moving on.
You can check if Docker is correctly configured on your machine by executing `docker info` in your terminal.
If it does not report an error (but shows information on your Docker system), you're good to go.

#### Starting LocalStack with Docker

You can start the Docker container simply by executing the following `docker run` command:

{{< tabpane text=true >}}

{{< tab header="Community" >}}
{{< command >}}
$ docker run \
  --rm -it \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4566:4566 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  localstack/localstack
{{< /command >}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab header="Pro" >}}
{{< command >}}
$ docker run \
  --rm -it \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4566:4566 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:443:443 \
  -e LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?} \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  localstack/localstack-pro{{< /tab >}}
{{< /command >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

{{< callout "note" >}}
- This command pulls the current nightly build from the `master` branch (if you don't have the image locally) and **not** the latest supported version.
  If you want to use a specific version of LocalStack, use the appropriate tag: `docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 localstack/localstack:<tag>`.
  Check-out the [LocalStack releases](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/releases) to know more about specific LocalStack versions.

- If you are using LocalStack with an [auth token]({{< ref "auth-token" >}}), you need to specify the image tag as `localstack/localstack-pro` in your Docker setup.
  Going forward, `localstack/localstack-pro` image will contain our Pro-supported services and APIs.

- This command reuses the image if it's already on your machine, i.e. it will **not** pull the latest image automatically from Docker Hub.

- Mounting the Docker socket `/var/run/docker.sock` as a volume is required for some services that use Docker to provide the emulation, such as AWS Lambda.
  Check out the [Lambda providers]({{< ref "user-guide/aws/lambda" >}}) documentation for more information.

- When using Docker to manually start LocalStack, you will have to configure the container on your own (see [docker-compose-pro.yml](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/master/docker-compose-pro.yml) and [Configuration]({{< ref "configuration" >}})).
  This could be seen as the "expert mode" of starting LocalStack.
  If you are looking for a simpler method of starting LocalStack, please use the [LocalStack CLI]({{< ref "#localstack-cli" >}}).

- To facilitate interoperability, configuration variables can be prefixed with `LOCALSTACK_` in docker.
  For instance, setting `LOCALSTACK_PERSISTENCE=1` is equivalent to `PERSISTENCE=1`.

- To configure an auth token, refer to the [auth token]({{< ref "auth-token" >}}) documentation.
{{< /callout >}}

### Helm

If you want to deploy LocalStack in your [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster, you can use [Helm](https://helm.sh).

#### Prerequisites

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

#### Deploy LocalStack using Helm

You can deploy LocalStack in a Kubernetes cluster by running these commands:
{{< command >}}
$ helm repo add localstack-repo https://helm.localstack.cloud
$ helm upgrade --install localstack localstack-repo/localstack
{{< / command >}}

The Helm charts are not maintained in the main repository, but in a [separate one](https://github.com/localstack/helm-charts).

## Updating

The LocalStack CLI allows you to easily update the different components of LocalStack.
To check the various options available for updating, run:
{{< command >}}
$ localstack update --help
Usage: localstack update [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Update different LocalStack components.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  all             Update all LocalStack components
  docker-images   Update docker images LocalStack depends on
  localstack-cli  Update LocalStack CLI
{{< / command >}}

{{< callout >}}
Updating the LocalStack CLI using `localstack update localstack-cli` and `localstack update all` will work only if it was installed from the Python distribution.
If it was installed using the pre-built binary or via Brew, please run the installation steps again to update to the latest version.
{{< /callout >}}

## Troubleshooting

#### The LocalStack CLI installation is successful, but I cannot execute `localstack`

If you can successfully install LocalStack using `pip` but you cannot use it in your terminal, you most likely haven't set up your operating system's / terminal's `PATH` variable (in order to tell them where to find programs installed via `pip`).
- If you are using Windows, you can enable the `PATH` configuration when installing Python, [as described in the official docs of Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#finding-the-python-executable).
- If you are using a MacOS or Linux operating system, please make sure that the `PATH` is correctly set up - either system wide, or in your terminal.

As a workaround you can call the LocalStack CLI python module directly:
{{< command >}}
$ python3 -m localstack.cli.main
{{< / command >}}

#### The `localstack` CLI does not start the LocalStack container

If you are using the `localstack` CLI to start LocalStack, but the container is not starting, please check the following:
- Uncheck the **Use kernel networking for UDP** option in Docker Desktop (**Settings** → **Resources** → **Network**) or follow the steps in our [documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/dns-server/#system-dns-configuration) to disable it.
- Start LocalStack with a specific DNS address:
{{< command >}}
$ DNS_ADDRESS=0 localstack start
{{< / command >}}
- Remove port 53 as indicated in our [standard `docker-compose.yml`  file](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/master/docker-compose-pro.yml).

#### How should I access the LocalStack logs on my local machine?

You can now avail logging output and error reporting using LocalStack logs.
To access the logs, run the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack logs
{{< / command >}}

AWS requests are now logged uniformly in the INFO log level (set by default or when `DEBUG=0`).
The format is:

```text
AWS <service>.<operation> => <http-status> (<error type>)
```

Requests to HTTP endpoints are logged in a similar way:

```text
2022-09-12T10:39:21.165  INFO --- [   asgi_gw_0] localstack.request.aws     : AWS s3.ListBuckets => 200
2022-09-12T10:39:41.315  INFO --- [   asgi_gw_0] localstack.request.aws     : AWS s3.CreateBucket => 200
2022-09-12T10:40:04.662  INFO --- [   asgi_gw_0] localstack.request.aws     : AWS s3.PutObject => 200
2022-09-12T11:01:55.799  INFO --- [   asgi_gw_0] localstack.request.http    : GET / => 200
```

#### How should I share the LocalStack logs for troubleshooting?

You can share the LocalStack logs with us to help us identify issues.
To share the logs, call the diagnostic endpoint:

{{< command >}}
$ curl -s localhost:4566/_localstack/diagnose | gzip -cf > diagnose.json.gz
{{< / command >}}

Ensure that the diagnostic endpoint is run after you have tried reproducing the affected task.
After running the task, run the diagnostic endpoint and share the archive file with your team members or LocalStack Support.

#### My application cannot reach LocalStack over the network

We have extensive network troubleshooting documentation available [here]({{< ref "references/network-troubleshooting" >}}).

If this does not solve your problem then please [reach out]({{< ref "help-and-support" >}}).
