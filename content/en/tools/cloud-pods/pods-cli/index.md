  The reference guide for LocalStack Cloud Pods CLI commands and how to get started on using them!
---

This reference provides descriptions and example commands for LocalStack Cloud Pods CLI (`pod`) commands.

## Syntax

Use the following syntax to run `localstack pod` commands from your terminal window:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack pod [command] [options]
{{< / command >}}

where `command` specifies the operation you want to perform with your Cloud Pods, e.g., `pull` or `push`, and `options` specifies the optional flag.
For example, you can attach a specific message to a snapshot using the `-m` option while doing a `commit` operation.

## Configuration

The CRUD commands exposed with the Cloud Pods CLI expect a `--name <pod_name>` option to specify the pod's name.
Users can avoid specifying a pod name at every command by setting a global config with the `config` command.

For instance, the following command:

```
localstack config --name my_pod
```
will implicitly pass a pod name to all subsequent CLI commands.
Such a configuration will be saved locally on the host machine in a JSON file (e.g., in `~/.localstack/cloudpods/pods-config.json`).

## Commands

### commit

The `commit` command creates a snapshot of your LocalStack running instance and locally saves it on the host machine.

**Synopsis**
```
Commit a snapshot of the LocalStack running instance.

Options:
  -m, --message TEXT   Add a comment describing the snapshot.
  -n, --name TEXT      Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -s, --services TEXT  Comma-delimited list of services to push in the pods (all, by default).
```

### config

The `config` command saves some configuration values that apply to all the subsequent CLI commands.
For instance with `localstack pod config --name <my_name>` users can avoid specifying a pod name for other commands like `pull` or `push`.
Users can specify a list of services with the following command:
```
localstack pod config --services sqs,sns
```
The following CRUD operation will only take into account the selected service and not the entire LocalStack application state.

**Synopsis**

```
Configure a set of parameters for all Cloud Pods commands.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT      Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -s, --services TEXT  Comma-delimited list of services or `all` to enable all (default).
```

### delete

The `delete` command let users delete their remote or local Cloud Pods.

**Synopsis**
```
Delete a Cloud Pod.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT  Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -l, --local      Delete only the local Cloud Pod, leaving the remote copy intact
```
### inject

The `inject` command let users inject a specific application state, previously saved, into the application runtime.
Please note that this is a local-only operation, i.e., the injecting state must be located on the host machine (usually under `~/.localstack/cloudpods/<pod_name>`).

By default, the injecting state updates the application runtime at a service level.
By using the `merge` injection strategy, the state of all services specified in the injecting state are reflected exactly in the application runtime, whilst all other active services remain unchanged.

The `--strategy` option can be used to change such default injection behaviour.
More specifically, the `overwrite` strategy will ensure the application runtime is an exact instance of the injecting state, and the `deep-merge` strategy will perform a fine-grain merge of the injecting state into the application runtime.

**Synopsis**
```
Inject the state from a locally available Cloud Pod version into the application runtime.

Options:
  -v, --version INTEGER  Version to inject (most recent one by default).
  -n, --name TEXT        Name of the cloud pod.
  -s, --strategy TEXT    Inject strategy (merge, overwrite, deep-merge).
```
### inspect

The `inspect` command simply lets the user inspect the content of a Cloud Pod.

**Synopsis**
```
Inspect the contents of a Cloud Pod.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT    Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -f, --format TEXT  Format (curses, rich, json).
```

### status

The `status` command compiles a report of LocalStack current in-memory application runtime, or state, listing what Cloud Pod and Cloud Pod version have contributed to each AWS Service.
The set of active, or loaded, AWS Services is also given in this report so to distinguish which are not derivatives of Cloud Pod operations.

The `-v` option extends the default report to also include the sequence of state changing Cloud Pod operations, listing for each the type and affected AWS Services.

**Synopsis**
```
Lists what Cloud Pods have contributed to each service's current in-memory state.

Options:
  -v, --verbose      Include sequence of state changing Cloud Pod operations in the output.
  -f, --format TEXT  Format (curses, rich, json).
```


### list

The `list` command displays all the available Cloud Pods.
By default, it only shows the pods that have been uploaded to the platform.
The `-l` option will also show the locally available pods. 
The `-p` option will list all the available public Cloud Pods.

**Synopsis**

List all available Cloud Pods.
```
Options:
  -l, --local   List also locally available Cloud Pods
  -p, --public  List all public Cloud Pods.
```
### pull

The `pull` command retrieves the content of a Cloud Pod previously created and uploaded to the LocalStack platform and injects it into the application runtime.

By default, the fetched pod updates the application runtime at a service level, utilising a `merge` injection strategy.
Like the `inject` command, the `--strategy` option can change such default injection behaviour.

**Synopsis**
```
Incorporate the state of a Cloud Pod into the application runtime.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT      Name of the cloud pod
  -s, --strategy TEXT  Inject strategy (merge, overwrite, deep-merge).
```
### push

The `push` command is used to create a new version of a Cloud Pods and upload it to the LocalStack platform.
A new version is created from the latest snapshot, e.g., taken with a previous `commit`.
A snapshot will be created at the moment of the push if no previous snapshot has been taken.
By default, a `push` operation will always retrieve the application state, create a Cloud Pod, and upload a version to the platform.
Users can use the `--local` flag if they wish to avoid the last step and keep the newly created pod on the host machine.
Users can also select a subset of AWS services they wish to incorporate in a new Cloud Pod version with the `--services` option.
Pushing an already existing pod results in creating a new version of it and, eventually, uploading it to the platform.

Users who want to make a Cloud Pod accessible outside their organization can mark it as *public* with the command `localstack pod push --name <pod_name> --visibility public`.
Please note that this command does not create a new version and requires a version to be already registered with the platform.

**Synopsis**
```
Create a new version of a Cloud Pod from the latest snapshot. A snapshot is created if it does not
exists yet.

Options:
  -l, --local            Create the Cloud Pod version only locally, without pushing to remote
  -m, --message TEXT     Add a comment describing the version.
  -n, --name TEXT        Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -s, --services TEXT    Comma-delimited list of services to push in the pods (all by default).
  --overwrite BOOLEAN    Overwrite a version with the content from the latest snapshot of the selected version.
  -v, --version INTEGER  Version to overwrite. Works with `--overwrite`.
  --visibility TEXT      Set the visibility of the Cloud Pod [`public` or `private`]. Does not create a new version.
```
### versions

The `versions` command simply lists all the available versions of a Cloud Pod.

**Synopsis**
```
List all available versions for a Cloud Pod.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT  Name of the Cloud Pod.
```
