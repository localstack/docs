  LocalStack provides a command line tool to manage the state of your instance via Cloud Pods.
---

## Syntax
Use the following syntax to run `localstack pod` commands from your terminal window:

```bash
localstack pod [command] [options]
```

where `command` specifies the operation you want to perform with your Cloud Pods, e.g., `pull` or `push`, and `options` specifies the optional flag. 
For example, you can attach a specific message to a snapshot using the `-m` option while doing a `commit` operation.

## Configuration
The CRUD commands exposed with the Cloud Pods CLI expect a `--name <pod_name>` option to specify the pod's name.
Users can avoid specifying a pod name at every command by setting a global config with the `config` command.

For instance, the following command
```
localstack config --name my_pod
```
will implicitly pass a pod name to all subsequent CLI commands. 
Such a configuration will be saved locally on the host machine in a JSON file (e.g., in `~/.localstack/cloudpods/pods-config.json`).

## Commands

### commit

The `commit` command creates a snapshot of your LocalStack running instance and locally saves it on the host machine. 

**Synopsis**
```
Commit a snapshot of the LocalStack running instance.

Options:
  -m, --message TEXT   Add a comment describing the snapshot.
  -n, --name TEXT      Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -s, --services TEXT  Comma-delimited list of services to push in the pods (all, by default).
```

### config

The `config` command saves some configuration values that apply to all the subsequent CLI commands. 
For instance with `localstack pod config --name <my_name>` users can avoid specifying a pod name for other commands like `pull` or `push`.
Users can specify a list of services with the following command:
```
localstack pod config --services sqs,sns
``` 
The following CRUD operation will only take into account the selected service and not the entire LocalStack application state.

**Synopsis**

```
Configure a set of parameters for all Cloud Pods commands.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT      Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -s, --services TEXT  Comma-delimited list of services or `all` to enable all (default).
```

### delete

The `delete` command let users delete their remote or local Cloud Pods.

**Synopsis**
```
Delete a Cloud Pod.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT  Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -l, --local      Delete only the local Cloud Pod, leaving the remote copy intact
```
### inject

The `inject` command let users inject a specific application state, previously saved, into the application runtime. 
Please note that this is a local-only operation, i.e., the injecting state must be located on the host machine (usually under `~/.localstack/cloudpods/<pod_name>`).

By default, the injecting state will replace the application runtime. 
The `--merge` option, instead, will first merge the injecting state with the current runtime and then inject the result. 

**Synopsis**
```
Inject the state from a locally available Cloud Pod version into the application runtime.

Options:
  --merge                Merge the injecting state with the current application runtime.
  -v, --version INTEGER  Version to inject (most recent one by default).
  -n, --name TEXT        Name of the cloud pod.
```
### inspect

The `inspect` command simply lets the user inspect the content of a Cloud Pod.

**Synopsis**
```
Inspect the contents of a Cloud Pod.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT    Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -f, --format TEXT  Format (curses, rich, json).
```
### list

The `list` command displays all the available Cloud Pods.
By default, it only shows the pods that have been uploaded to the platform. 
The `-l` option will also show the locally available pods.

**Synopsis**

List all available Cloud Pods.
```
Options:
  -l, --local  List also locally available Cloud Pods
```
### pull

The `pull` command retrieves the content of a Cloud Pod previously created and uploaded to the LocalStack platform and injects it into the application runtime.
By default, the fetched pod will always be injected. 
The `--fetch` option will instead only trigger the download of the desired Cloud Pods to the host machine, without performing any additional operation.
Users could then, for instance, use the `--inject` command to inject the retrieved pods.
Similar to the `--inject` command, users can specify the `--merge` flag (off by default) if they wish to merge the current application state with the injecting one.

**Synopsis**
```
Incorporate the state of a Cloud Pod into the application runtime.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT  Name of the cloud pod
  --merge          Merge the injecting state with the current application runtime.
  --fetch          Only fetch the Cloud Pod from the remote platform.
```
### push

The `push` command is used to create a new version of a Cloud Pods and upload it to the LocalStack platform.
A new version is created from the latest snapshot, e.g., taken with a previous `commit`. 
A snapshot will be created at the moment of the push if no previous snapshot has been taken.
By default, a `push` operation will always retrieve the application state, create a Cloud Pod, and upload a version to the platform.
Users can use the `--local` flag if they wish to avoid the last step and keep the newly created pod on the host machine.
Users can also select a subset of AWS services they wish to incorporate in a new Cloud Pod version with the `--services` option.
Pushing an already existing pod results in creating a new version of it and, eventually, uploading it to the platform.

**Synopsis**
```
Create a new version of a Cloud Pod from the latest snapshot. A snapshot is created if it does not 
exists yet.

Options:
  -l, --local            Create the Cloud Pod version only locally, without pushing to remote
  -m, --message TEXT     Add a comment describing the version.
  -n, --name TEXT        Name of the Cloud Pod.
  -s, --services TEXT    Comma-delimited list of services to push in the pods (all by default).
  --overwrite BOOLEAN    Overwrite a version with the content from the latest snapshot of the selected
                         version.
  -v, --version INTEGER  Version to overwrite. Works with `--overwrite`
```
### versions

The `versions` command simply lists all the available versions of a Cloud Pod.

**Synopsis**
```
List all available versions for a Cloud Pod.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT  Name of the Cloud Pod.
```
