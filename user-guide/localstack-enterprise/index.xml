This offline functionality is enabled by:
Pre-installed packages required for running specific services that are usually downloaded on demand (such as opensearch or dynamodb-local). A certificate keypair for localhost.localstack.cloud to resolve to the LocalStack container via our DNS server. An embedded decryption key in the image, eliminating the need to contact the license server to operate LocalStack.</description></item><item><title>K8s Operator</title><link>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/k8s-operator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/k8s-operator/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack K8s operator is a custom Kubernetes operator that offers LocalStack emulator as a native resource in Kubernetes environments.

It allows you to run these services as Kubernetes pods in your Kubernetes clusters. By default, LocalStack uses the docker backend for these services. You can use either service-specific configuration variables or the generic CONTAINER_RUNTIME variable set to kubernetes to enable the Kubernetes executor.
EC2 Kubernetes Executor The LocalStack Enterprise image allows you to run EC2 instances on Kubernetes. You can do so by setting the EC2_VM_MANAGER environment variable to kubernetes in the LocalStack container.</description></item><item><title>CI Analytics</title><link>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/ci-analytics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/ci-analytics/</guid><description>Introduction CI Analytics is a feature of LocalStack Web Application that allows users to get insights into their CI builds.
