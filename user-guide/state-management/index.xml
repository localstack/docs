Cloud Pods can be used for various purposes, such as:
Save and manage snapshots of active LocalStack instances. Share state snapshots with your team to debug collectively. Automate your testing pipelines by pre-seeding CI environments. Create reproducible development and testing environments locally. Installation You can save and load the persistent state of Cloud Pods, you can use the Cloud Pods command-line interface (CLI).</description></item><item><title>Persistence</title><link>/user-guide/state-management/persistence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/state-management/persistence/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s Persistence mechanism enables the saving and restoration of the entire LocalStack state, including all AWS resources and data, on your local machine.

This mechanism ensures a quick and efficient way to preserve and continue your work with AWS resources locally.
Configuration To start snapshot-based persistence, launch LocalStack with the configuration option PERSISTENCE=1.</description></item><item><title>Export &amp; Import State</title><link>/user-guide/state-management/export-import-state/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/state-management/export-import-state/</guid><description>Introduction The Export/Import State feature enables you to export the state of your LocalStack instance into a file and import it into another LocalStack instance. This feature is useful when you want to save your LocalStack instance&amp;rsquo;s state for later use.
