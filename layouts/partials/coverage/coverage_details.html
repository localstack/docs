This section gives an overview about the internal integration test suite and the specific test cases that recorded the API call.
<p>
<h3 id="howtoread">How to read the test details?</h3>
<div>For each operation we put up a list of the related integration test cases.
<br/>
Those operation calls have been recorded during the execution of the outlined test cases.
Some calls might be internal, i.e., they are not explicitly called in the test, but are triggered implicitly by the LocalStack framework.

<ul>
    <li><b>Parameters:</b> The tests are ordered by the parameters used, which are highlighted in bold.</li>
    <li><b>Test Details:</b> <a href="https://github.com/localstack/localstack">LocalStack Community</a> or <em>LocalStack Pro</em> indicates where the test originates. For each test you see:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>test name</li>
            <li>status code returned (which is the expected one for the test case)</li>
            <li>information about validation:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="coverage-report-tag-aws-validated">AWS validated</span> the test is validated against AWS, meaning it run successfully against real AWS as well</li>
                <li><span class="coverage-report-tag-snapshot">Snapshot Tested</span> this is a <a href="/contributing/parity-testing/">snapshot parity test</a>, meaning the responses are validated against AWS</li>
