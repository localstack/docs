## Emulation Levels

* CRUD: The service accepts requests and returns proper (potentially static) responses.
  No additional business logic besides storing entities.
* Emulated: The service imitates the functionality, including synchronous and asynchronous business logic operating on service entities.

| Service / Feature | Implementation status | Emulation Level | Limitations |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
