It enables you to create, update, and manage resources in a repeatable and automated manner using declarative templates. With CloudFormation, you can use JSON or YAML templates to define your desired infrastructure state. You can specify resources, their configurations, dependencies, and relationships in these templates.
LocalStack supports CloudFormation, allowing you to use the CloudFormation APIs in your local environment to declaratively define your architecture on the AWS, including resources such as S3 Buckets, Lambda Functions, and much more.</description></item><item><title>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</title><link>/user-guide/aws/ec2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/ec2/</guid><description>Introduction Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a core service within Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable and flexible virtual computing resources. EC2 enables users to launch and manage virtual machines, referred to as instances.
LocalStack allows you to use the EC2 APIs in your local environment to create and manage EC2 instances and related resources such as VPCs, EBS volumes, etc. The list of supported APIs can be found on the API coverage page.</description></item><item><title>Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</title><link>/user-guide/aws/eks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/eks/</guid><description>Introduction Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without installing, operating, and maintaining your own Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating containerized applications&amp;rsquo; deployment, scaling, and management.
LocalStack allows you to use the EKS APIs in your local environment to spin up embedded Kubernetes clusters in your local Docker engine or use an existing Kubernetes installation you can access from your local machine (defined in $HOME/.</description></item><item><title>EventBridge</title><link>/user-guide/aws/events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/events/</guid><description>Introduction EventBridge provides a centralized mechanism to discover and communicate events across various AWS services and applications. EventBridge allows you to register, track, and resolve events, which indicates a change in the environment and then applies a rule to route the event to a target. EventBridge rules are tied to an Event Bus to manage event-driven workflows. You can use either identity-based or resource-based policies to control access to EventBridge resources, where the former can be attached to IAM users, groups, and roles, and the latter can be attached to specific AWS resources.</description></item><item><title>EventBridge Pipes</title><link>/user-guide/aws/pipes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/pipes/</guid><description>Introduction EventBridge Pipes allows users to create point-to-point integrations between event producers and consumers with transform, filter and enrichment steps. Pipes are particularly useful for scenarios involving real-time data processing, application integration, and automated workflows, while simplifying the process of routing events between AWS services. Pipes offer a point-to-point connection from one source to one target (one-to-one). In contrast, EventBridge Event Bus offers a one-to-many integration where an event router delivers one event to zero or more destinations.</description></item><item><title>Lambda</title><link>/user-guide/aws/lambda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/lambda/</guid><description>Introduction AWS Lambda is a Serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) platform that lets you run code in your preferred programming language on the AWS ecosystem. AWS Lambda automatically scales your code to meet demand and handles server provisioning, management, and maintenance. AWS Lambda allows you to break down your application into smaller, independent functions that integrate seamlessly with AWS services.
LocalStack allows you to use the Lambda APIs to create, deploy, and test your Lambda functions.</description></item><item><title>Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK)</title><link>/user-guide/aws/msk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/msk/</guid><description>Introduction Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) is a fully managed Apache Kafka service that allows you to build and run applications that process streaming data. MSK offers a centralized platform to facilitate seamless communication between various AWS services and applications through event-driven architectures, facilitating data ingestion, processing, and analytics for various applications. MSK also features automatic scaling and built-in monitoring, allowing users to build robust, high-throughput data pipelines.
LocalStack allows you to use the MSK APIs in your local environment to spin up Kafka clusters on the local machine, create topics for exchanging messages, and define event source mappings that trigger Lambda functions when messages are received on a certain topic.</description></item><item><title>Relational Database Service (RDS)</title><link>/user-guide/aws/rds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/rds/</guid><description>Introduction Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to setup, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. RDS allows you to deploy and manage various relational database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Microsoft SQL Server. RDS handles routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling.
LocalStack allows you to use the RDS APIs in your local environment to create and manage RDS clusters and instances for testing &amp;amp; integration purposes.</description></item></channel></rss>
