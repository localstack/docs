This offline functionality is enabled by:
Pre-installed packages required for running specific services that are usually downloaded on demand (such as opensearch or dynamodb-local). A certificate keypair for localhost.localstack.cloud to resolve to the LocalStack container via our DNS server. An embedded decryption key in the image, eliminating the need to contact the license server to operate LocalStack.</description></item><item><title>SSO for Azure AD</title><link>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/single-sign-on/azure-ad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/single-sign-on/azure-ad/</guid><description>To configure SSO with an Azure AD Enterprise application, we provide a simple step-by-step solution below:

It allows you to run EC2 instances, ECS tasks, and Lambda functions in your Kubernetes clusters. By default, LocalStack uses the docker backend for compute services. You can switch to the kubernetes executor by setting the appropriate environment variables.
EC2 Kubernetes Executor The LocalStack Enterprise image allows you to run EC2 instances on Kubernetes. You can do so by setting the EC2_VM_MANAGER environment variable to kubernetes in the LocalStack container.</description></item><item><title>CI Analytics</title><link>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/ci-analytics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/localstack-enterprise/ci-analytics/</guid><description>Introduction CI Analytics is a feature of LocalStack Web Application that allows users to get insights into their CI builds. CI Analytics unifies additional features, such as Cloud Pods &amp;amp; Stack Insights, and augments them with an integrated view of CI builds to provide users with insights and facilitate debugging.

Log Output: Enables viewing of detailed logs for individual CI builds.</description></item><item><title>AWS Fault Injection Service</title><link>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/fault-injection-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/fault-injection-service/</guid><description>Introduction The Fault Injection Service is a fully managed service by AWS designed to help you improve the resilience of your applications by simulating real-world outages and operational issues. This service allows you to conduct controlled experiments on your AWS infrastructure, injecting faults and observing how your system responds under various conditions.
By using the Fault Injection Service, you can identify weaknesses, test recovery procedures, and ensure that your applications can withstand unexpected disruptions.</description></item><item><title>Chaos API</title><link>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/chaos-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/chaos-api/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack Chaos API allows you to mimic outages across any AWS region or service. Intentionally triggering service outages and monitoring the system&amp;rsquo;s response in situations where the infrastructure is compromised offers a powerful way to test. This strategy helps gauge the effectiveness of the system&amp;rsquo;s deployment procedures and its resilience against infrastructure disruptions, which is a key element of chaos engineering.

The migration can be homogeneous (source and target have the same type), but often times is heterogeneous as it supports migration from various sources to various targets (self-hosted and AWS services).
LocalStack only supports selected use cases for DMS at the moment. The supported APIs are available on our API coverage page, which provides information on the extent of DMS integration with LocalStack.</description></item><item><title>Fault Injection Service (FIS)</title><link>/user-guide/aws/fis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/fis/</guid><description>Introduction Fault Injection Service (FIS) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that enables you to test the resilience of your applications and infrastructure by injecting faults and failures into your AWS resources. FIS simulates faults such as resource unavailability and service errors to assess the impact on your application&amp;rsquo;s performance and availability. The full list of such possible fault injections is available in the AWS docs.
LocalStack allows you to use the FIS APIs in your local environment to introduce faults in other services, in order to check how your setup behaves when parts of it stop working locally.</description></item><item><title>Outages Extension</title><link>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/outages-extension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/outages-extension/</guid><description>Introduction Warning Outages Extension has been deprecated. It is recommended to migrate to the Chaos API. The LocalStack Outages Extension allows you to mimic outages across any AWS region or service. By integrating the Outages Extension using the LocalStack Extension mechanism, you can assess your infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s robustness. Intentionally triggering service outages and monitoring the system&amp;rsquo;s response in situations where the infrastructure is compromised offers a powerful way to test. This strategy helps gauge the effectiveness of the system&amp;rsquo;s deployment procedures and its resilience against infrastructure disruptions, which is a key element of chaos engineering.</description></item></channel></rss>
