Route53&amp;rsquo;s health checks and traffic redirection enhance architecture resilience and ensure service continuity during regional outages, crucial for uninterrupted user experiences.
Note Route53 Failover and Chaos API is currently available as part of the Ultimate plan. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to try it out, please contact us to request access.</description></item><item><title>Chaos Engineering: Simulating Outages using Chaos API</title><link>/tutorials/simulating-outages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/simulating-outages/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack Chaos API is capable of simulating infrastructure faults to allow conducting controlled chaos engineering tests on AWS infrastructure. Its purpose is to uncover vulnerabilities and improve system robustness. Chaos API offers a means to deliberately introduce failures and observe their impacts, helping developers to better equip their systems against actual outages.
Getting started In this tutorial we study the effects of outages on a sample AWS application. We use the Chaos API to simulate the outage and design a mitigation to make the application resilient against database outages.</description></item></channel></rss>
