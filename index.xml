The LocalStack &amp;amp; LocalStack Pro Docker images have been downloaded over 130+ million times and provide a multi-arch build compatible with AMD/x86 and ARM-based CPU architectures.</description></item><item><title>External Service Port Range</title><link>/references/external-ports/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/external-ports/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack provides local cloud services, such as OpenSearch or Elasticsearch, which might utilize external software bound to specific ports. This documentation discusses two approaches to access these external services within LocalStack and explores the concept of an external service port range.
Proxy Functionality for External Services LocalStack offers a proxy functionality to access external services indirectly. In this approach, LocalStack assigns local domains to the external services based on the individual service&amp;rsquo;s configuration.</description></item><item><title>Filesystem Layout</title><link>/references/filesystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/filesystem/</guid><description>This page describes the filesystem directory layout used internally by LocalStack.

EventBridge allows you to register, track, and resolve events, which indicates a change in the environment and then applies a rule to route the event to a target. EventBridge rules are tied to an Event Bus to manage event-driven workflows. You can use either identity-based or resource-based policies to control access to EventBridge resources, where the former can be attached to IAM users, groups, and roles, and the latter can be attached to specific AWS resources.</description></item><item><title>EventBridge Pipes</title><link>/user-guide/aws/pipes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/pipes/</guid><description>Introduction EventBridge Pipes allows users to create point-to-point integrations between event producers and consumers with transform, filter and enrichment steps. Pipes are particularly useful for scenarios involving real-time data processing, application integration, and automated workflows, while simplifying the process of routing events between AWS services. Pipes offer a point-to-point connection from one source to one target (one-to-one). In contrast, EventBridge Event Bus offers a one-to-many integration where an event router delivers one event to zero or more destinations.</description></item><item><title>EventBridge Scheduler</title><link>/user-guide/aws/scheduler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/scheduler/</guid><description>Introduction EventBridge Scheduler is a service that enables you to schedule the execution of your AWS Lambda functions, Amazon ECS tasks, and Amazon Batch jobs.
