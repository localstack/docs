For developing AWS applications locally, the tool of choice is LocalStack, which can sustain a full-blown comprehensive stack.

For example a VPC defined by another team to contain the application infrastructure. This makes it harder to deploy applications into LocalStack as these resource dependencies must be deployed first. These dependencies may not live in IaC where deployment is easy, or accessing the IaC may not be easy.

Pulling the LocalStack image With the multi-arch Docker manifest, your Docker client (and therefore the LocalStack CLI) now automatically selects the image according to your platform: $ docker pull localstack/localstack You can check the architecture of the pulled image by using docker inspect: $ docker inspect localstack/localstack | jq &amp;#39;.</description></item><item><title>Credentials</title><link>/references/credentials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/credentials/</guid><description>Like AWS, LocalStack requires AWS credentials to be supplied in all API operations.
Access Key ID For root accounts, the choice of access key ID affects multi-account namespacing.

You can start your LocalStack instance and go to http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/swagger to browse the Swagger UI, visualize and interact with all the API&amp;rsquo;s resources implemented in LocalStack.</description></item><item><title>Logging</title><link>/references/logging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/logging/</guid><description>LocalStack supports logging output and error reporting through the localstack CLI or a Docker/Docker Compose based setup. LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s logging setup allows you to:
Discover errors in your code during development &amp;amp; testing. Get visibility into how and why your API calls are failing. Figure out unexpected errors such as Lambda timeouts and more! With LocalStack logging, you can easily retrieve additional detail around errors using various configuration variables to specify the verbosity and the log level.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Account Setups</title><link>/references/multi-account-setups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/multi-account-setups/</guid><description>Note Please note that multi-accounts may not work for use-cases that have cross-account and cross-service access. See this issue for more information. LocalStack ships with multi-account support which allows namespacing based on AWS account ID.
LocalStack uses the value in the AWS Access Key ID field for the purpose of namespacing over account ID. For more information, see Credentials.
The Access Key ID field can be configured in the AWS CLI in multiple ways: please refer to AWS CLI documentation.</description></item><item><title>Podman</title><link>/references/podman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/podman/</guid><description>Introduction By default, the LocalStack CLI starts the LocalStack runtime inside a Docker container. Docker may not be available on your system, and a popular alternative is Podman which you can use to run LocalStack. Podman support is still experimental, and the following docs give you an overview of the current state.
From the Podman docs:
Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images.</description></item><item><title>Usage Tracking</title><link>/references/usage-tracking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/usage-tracking/</guid><description>Overview For license activations, we track the timestamp and the licensing credentials. We need to do this to make CI credits work. It is tracked regardless of whether the user disables event tracking since we collect this in the backend, not the client.

EventBridge allows you to register, track, and resolve events, which indicates a change in the environment and then applies a rule to route the event to a target. EventBridge rules are tied to an Event Bus to manage event-driven workflows. You can use either identity-based or resource-based policies to control access to EventBridge resources, where the former can be attached to IAM users, groups, and roles, and the latter can be attached to specific AWS resources.</description></item><item><title>EventBridge Pipes</title><link>/user-guide/aws/pipes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/pipes/</guid><description>Introduction EventBridge Pipes allows users to create point-to-point integrations between event producers and consumers with transform, filter and enrichment steps. Pipes are particularly useful for scenarios involving real-time data processing, application integration, and automated workflows, while simplifying the process of routing events between AWS services. Pipes offer a point-to-point connection from one source to one target (one-to-one). In contrast, EventBridge Event Bus offers a one-to-many integration where an event router delivers one event to zero or more destinations.</description></item><item><title>EventBridge Scheduler</title><link>/user-guide/aws/scheduler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/aws/scheduler/</guid><description>Introduction EventBridge Scheduler is a service that enables you to schedule the execution of your AWS Lambda functions, Amazon ECS tasks, and Amazon Batch jobs.

Resource Groups allow for a unified view of their resources allowing developers to perform specific actions, such as resource tagging, access control, and policy enforcement across multiple resources simultaneously. Resource Groups in AWS provide two types of queries that developers can use to build groups: Tag-based queries and CloudFormation stack-based queries. With Tag-based queries, developers can organize resources based on common attributes or characteristics, while CloudFormation stack-based queries allow developers to group resources that are deployed together as part of a CloudFormation stack.</description></item><item><title>Resource Groups</title><link>/references/coverage/coverage_resource-groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/coverage/coverage_resource-groups/</guid><description>Coverage Overview Resource Groups is supported by LocalStack in the community image.
