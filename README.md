## LocalStack Documentation has moved!

We've launched [**LocalStack Docs v2**](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-docs), introducing a complete systems-level redesign of our documentation experience. 😻 🎉

## What’s New in LocalStack Docs v2?
- A brand-new Information Architecture 
- Multiple cloud platforms (AWS, Snowflake, and more coming!)
- Task-based navigation focused on developer goals
- A clear separation of capabilities, integrations, tooling, and services
- A cleaner, more responsive user interface powered by Astro Starlight

## Where Can I Find the New LocalStack Docs Repo?
Our new docs repo is right over here: [github.com/localstack/localstack-docs](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-docs).

🗺️ ❤️ Our docs are still **100% open-source** 🗺️ ❤️, and we *love* [docs contributions from our community](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-docs/issues/new).

Whether it’s fixing a typo or adding a new doc, we’d love your help in making LocalStack Docs even better!
